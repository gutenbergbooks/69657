  <p class="drop-cap">THE intent of this Treatise is to oblige the curious in the Antiquities
    of Britain: it is an account of places and things from inspection, not
    compiled from others’ labours, or travels in one’s study. I own it is a
    work crude and hasty, like the notes of a traveller that stays not long
    in a place; and such it was in reality. Many matters I threw in only
    as hints for further scrutiny, and memorandums for myself or others:
    above all, I avoided prejudice, never carrying any author along with
    me, but taking things in the natural order and manner they presented
    themselves: and if my sentiments of Roman stations, and other matters,
    happen not to coincide with what has been wrote before me; it was
    not that I differ from them, but things did not so appear to me. The
    prints, beside their use in illustrating the discourses, are ranged in
    such a manner as to become an index of inquiries for those that travel,
    or for a British Antiquary. I shall probably continue this method at
    reasonable intervals. The whole is to invite Gentlemen and others in
    the country, to make researches of this nature, and to acquaint the
    world with them: they may be assured, that whatever accounts of this
    sort they please to communicate to me, they shall be applied to proper
    use, and all due honour paid to the names of those that favour me with
    a correspondence so much to the glory and benefit of our country, which
    is my sole aim therein.</p>

  <p>It is evident how proper engravings are to preserve the memory of
    things, and how much better an idea they convey to the mind than
    written descriptions, which often not at all, oftener not sufficiently,
    explain them: beside, they present us with the pleasure of observing
    the various changes in the face of nature, of countries, and the
    like, through the current of time and vicissitude of things. These
    embellishments are the chief <em>desiderata</em> of the excellent Mr.
    Camden’s <cite>Britannia</cite>, and other writers of this sort, whose pens
    were not so ready to deliver their sentiments in lines as letters: and
    how hard it is for common artificers to draw from mere description,
    or to express well what they understand not, is obvious from our
    engravings in all sciences. I am sensible enough, that large allowances
    must be made for my own performances in this kind, and some for the
    artificers parts therein, who, for want of more practice in such works,
    cannot equal others abroad. I know not whether it will be an excuse, or
    a fault, if I should plead the expedition I used in the drawing part;
    but I may urge, that a private person, and a moderate fortune, may want
    many useful assistants and conveniences for that purpose. It is enough
    for me to point them out; to show things that are fine in themselves,
    and want little art to render them more agreeable, or that deserve to
    be better done; or any way to contribute toward retrieving the noble
    monuments of our ancestors; in which case only, we are behind other
    the learned nations in Europe. It is not that we have a less fund of
    curiosities than they, were the description of them attempted by an
    abler hand, and more adequate experience.</p>

  <p>Two or three of the plates are inserted only as heads, being not
    referred to in the discourse, as Tab. VIII. the ground-plot of the
    ruins of Whitehall. I myself never saw the palace, but was pleased
    that I chanced to take this draught of its ruinous ichnography, but
    the very week before totally destroyed. Thus much I thought owing to
    the venerable memory of that name, which is ever the word at sea with
    British ships, and which makes the whole world tremble. Tab. X. is an
    ancient seal of the bishops of Norwich.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This plate the learned and
    curious Mr. le Neve, Norroy king at arms, lent me out of his good will
    to promote the work: the seal is remarkable for having letters upon the
    edge, represented in the empty ringlet; the manner of it is like our
    milled money; but how it was performed in wax, is not easy to say. Tab.
    XV. was likewise lent me by Mr. Norroy abovesaid. I design always, in
    these collections of mine, to insert one plate in a hundred, of some
    person’s <em>effigies</em> that has deserved well of the antiquities of
    Britain: it is but a just piece of gratitude to their
    memory. Tab. XL. (the Greek view at Athens) I took from an original
    drawing in Mr. Talman’s collection. I have some more of that sort:
    though they relate not to Britain, I do not fear the reader will be
    displeased with me on that account. How much rather ought we to lament
    the scarcity of such! What noble monuments of Greece are sunk into
    eternal oblivion, through want of Drawing in travellers that have been
    there in great numbers, or for want of encouragement to those that
    are able! With what regret do I mention that most beautiful temple of
    Minerva in the citadel of Athens, without dispute the finest building
    upon the globe, <i>anno</i> 1694! that year it was casually blown up
    with gunpowder, and not a drawing of it preserved.</p>

  <p>The last plate, of the great conjunction of the five planets, I added
    as an <em>æra</em> of my book. This memorable appearance, because it
    affected not the vulgar like a solar eclipse, was almost neglected
    by the learned. I had a mind to do it justice by printing the type
    of it from the diagram sent me by the great Dr. Halley. For my part,
    I congratulate myself for living in an age fruitful of these grand
    phænomena of the celestial bodies, and am pleased, that beside the
    total eclipse 1715, we have in the space of two years this great
    conjunction, a transit of Mercury across the sun, a comet, the last
    eclipse of the sun, and in March next another great conjunction.</p>

  <p>The numerous plates I have given the reader, of ground-plots and
    prospects of Roman cities, I thought contributed much towards fixing
    their site, and preserving their memory: they may be useful to curious
    inhabitants, in marking the places where antiquities are found from
    time to time, and in other respects. There are some few errors of the
    press escaped me, notwithstanding all my care; but none, I think, of
    any consequence. I have taken care to make the Index as instructing
    as I could. The title of <em>Roman roads</em> belongs to such as are
    anonymous, or not commonly taken notice of: that of <em>Roman coins</em>
    points to such places as are not Roman towns, or particularly
    described. <em>Etymology</em> includes only such words as are scattered
    casually in the work, or matters that are not comprehended under any
    other head; and so of the rest.</p>

  <p>One general observation I have made within the short space of time
    my travels were limited to, that husbandry, grazing, cultivation of
    waste lands, all sorts of trades and manufactures, towns and cities,
    are hugely improved; and especially the multitude of inhabitants is
    increased to a high proportion: the reason of it is not difficult to be
    guessed at.</p>

  <p>What I shall next trouble the reader withall, will be my intended work,
    of the history of the ancient Celts, particularly the first inhabitants
    of Great Britain, which for the most part is now finished. By what I
    can judge at present, it will consist of four books in folio. I. The
    history of the origin and passage of the Celts from Asia into the west
    of Europe, particularly into Britain; of their manners, language, &amp;c.
    II. Of the religion, deities, priests, temples, and sacred rites, of
    the Celts. III. Of the great Celtic temple at Abury in Wiltshire, and
    others of that sort. IV. Of the celebrated Stonehenge. There will be
    above 300 copper plates of a folio size, many of which are already
    engraven; and many will be of much larger dimensions. Upon account,
    therefore, of the vast expence attending this work, I shall print no
    more than are subscribed for; the money to be paid to me only. Thus
    much I thought fit to advertise the friendly reader.</p>

    have an inclination for such enquiries: that the rest which follow are
    grown to such a bulk as to become the present volume, is owing to my
    residence at London. Great as are the advantages of this capital, for

  <p class="noindent">which engages me to make an excursion now and then into the country:
    and this is properly taking a review of pure nature; for life here
    may be called only artificial, especially when fixed down to it;
    like the gaudy entries upon a theatre, where a pompous character is
    supported for a little while, and then makes an exit soon forgotten.
    My ancestors, both paternal and maternal, having lived, from times
    immemorial, in or upon the edges of our marshy level, perhaps gave me
    that melancholic disposition, which renders the bustlings of an active
    and showy life disagreeable. The fair allurements of the business of
    a profession, which have been in my road, cannot induce me wholly to
    forsake the sweet recesses of contemplation, that real life, that
    tranquillity of mind, only to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> met with in proper solitude; where I
    might make the most of the pittance of time allotted by Fate, and if
    possible doubly over enjoy its fleeting space. I own a man is born for
    his country and his friends, and that he ought to serve them in his
    best capacity; yet he confessedly claims a share in himself: and that,
    in my opinion, is enjoying one’s self; not, as the vulgar think, in
    heaping up immoderate riches, titles of honour, or in empty, irrational
    pleasures, but in storing the mind with the valuable treasures of the
    knowledge of divine and human things. And this may in a very proper
    sense be called the study of Antiquities.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>Of the study of</i> <span class="smcap">Antiquities</span>.</div>

  <p>I need not make an apology to you for that which some people of
    terrestrial minds think to be a meagre and useless matter; for
    truly what is this study, but searching into the fountain-head of
    all learning and truth? Some antient philosophers have thought that
    knowledge is only reminiscence. If we extend this notion no further
    than as to what has been said and done before us, we shall not be
    mistaken in asserting that the past ages bore men of as good parts as
    we: enquiry into their thoughts and actions is learning; and happy for
    us if we can improve upon them, and find out things they did not know,
    by help of their own clue. All things upon this voluble globe are but
    a succession, like the stream of a river: the higher you go, the purer
    the fluid, less tainted with corruptions of prejudice or craft, with
    the mud and soil of ignorance. Here are the things themselves to study
    upon; not words only, wherein too much of learning has consisted. If
    we examine into the antiquities of nations that had no writing among
    them, here are their monuments: these we are to explore, to strike
    out their latent meaning; and the more we reason upon them, the more
    reason shall we find to admire the vast size of the gigantic minds
    of our predecessors, the great and simple majesty of their works,
    and wherein mainly lies the beauty and the excellence of matters of
    antiquity. But more especially it is not without a happy omen, that
    the moderns have exerted themselves in earnest, to rake up every dust
    of past times, moved by the evident advantages therefrom accruing, in
    the understanding their invaluable writings, which have escaped the
    common shipwreck of time. It is from this method we must obtain an
    accurate intelligence of those principles of learning and foundations
    of all science: it is from them we advance our minds immediately to the
    state of manhood, and without them the world 5000 years old would but
    begin to think like a child. Nothing more illustrates this than looking
    into the comments that were wrote upon them 200 years ago, voluminous
    enough, but barbarous, poor, and impertinent, when compared to the
    solid performances of learned men since, whose heads were enriched with
    an exact search into the customs, manners and monuments of the writers.
    Hence it is, that history, geography, mathematics, philosophy, the
    learned professions, law, divinity, our own faculty, and the muses in
    general, flourish like a fresh garden richly watered and cultivated,
    weeded from rubbish of logomachy and barren mushrooms, gay with
    thriving and beautiful plants of true erudition, inoculated upon the
    stocks of the antients.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>Of</i> <span class="smcap">Britain</span>.</div>

  <p>If ruminating upon antiquities at home be commendable, travelling at
    home for that purpose can want no defence; it is still coming nearer
    the lucid springs of truth. The satisfaction of viewing realities has
    led infinite numbers of its admirers through the labours and dangers
    of strange countries, through oceans, immoderate heats and colds, over
    rugged mountains, barren sands and deserts, savage inhabitants, and a
    million of perils; and the world is filled with accounts of them. We
    export yearly our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> treasures into foreign parts, by the genteel and
    fashionable <em>tours</em> of France and Italy, and import ship-loads
    of books relating to their antiquities and history (it is well if we
    bring back nothing worse) whilst our own country lies like a neglected
    province. Like untoward children, we look back with contempt upon our
    own mother. The antient Albion, the valiant Britain, the renowned
    England, big with all the blessings of indulgent nature, fruitful
    in strengths of genius, in the great, the wise, the magnanimous,
    the learned and the fair, is postponed to all nations. Her immense
    wealth, traffic, industry; her flowing streams, her fertile plains,
    her delightful elevations, pleasant prospects, curious antiquities,
    flourishing cities, commodious inns, courteous inhabitants, her
    temperate air, her glorious show of liberty, every gift of providence
    that can make her the envy and the desirable mistress of the whole
    earth, is slighted and disregarded.</p>

  <p>You, Sir, to whom I pretend not to talk in this manner, well know that
    I had a desire by this present work, however mean, to rouse up the
    spirit of the Curious among us, to look about them and admire their
    native furniture: to show them we have rarities of domestic growth.
    What I offer them is an account of my journeyings hitherto, but little
    indeed, and with expedition enough, with accuracy no more than may be
    expected from a traveller; for truth in every particular, I can vouch
    only for my own share, strangers must owe somewhat to informations. I
    can assure you I endeavoured as much as possible not to be deceived,
    nor to deceive the reader. It was ever my opinion that a more intimate
    knowledge of Britain more becomes us, is more useful and as worthy a
    part of education for our young nobility and gentry as the view of any
    transmarine parts. And if I have learnt by seeing some places, men and
    manners, or have any judgment in things, it is not impossible to make a
    classic journey on this side the streights of Dover.</p>

  <p>Thus much at least I thought fit to premise in favour of the study of
    antiquities. And with particular deference to the society of British
    Antiquaries in London, to whom I remember with pleasure you first
    introduced me: since for some time I have had the honour of being their
    secretary; to them I beg leave to consecrate the following work. To
    the right honourable the Earl of Hartford the illustrious and worthy
    President, the right honourable the Earl of Winchelsea, Peter le Neve,
    esq; Roger Gale, esq; the illustrious and worthy Vice-presidents, and
    to the learned Members thereof. Then, lest I should fall under my own
    censure passed upon others, that know least of things nearest them, I
    shall deliver my thoughts about the history of <span class="smcap">Holland</span> before
    mentioned, which may serve as a short comment upon the map of this
    country which I published last year, with a purpose of assisting the
    gentlemen that are commissioners of sewers there, though it is of such
    a bulk as cannot conveniently be inserted into this volume.</p>

  <p>If we cast our eyes upon the geography of England, we must observe that
    much of the eastern shore is flat, low ground, whilst the western is
    steep and rocky. This holds generally true throughout the globe as to
    its great parts, countries or islands, and likewise particularly as to
    its little ones, mountains and plains. I mean, that mountains are steep
    and abrupt to the west,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> especially the north-west, and have a gentle
    declivity eastward or to the south-east, and that plains ever descend
    eastward. I wonder very much that this remark has never been made. I
    took notice of it in our own country, almost before <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>I had ever been
    out of it, in the universal declivity of that level eastward, in those
    parts where it did not by that means regard the ocean; particularly in
    South Holland, or the wapentake of Elho: the natural descent of water
    therein is not to the sea, as the rivers run, but directly eastward,
    and that very considerable. Beside, the current of every river is lower
    as more eastward: thus the Welland is higher in level than the Nen,
    the Nen than the Ouse; and probably at first both emptied themselves
    by the Ouse or Lyn river as most eastward. I observed in June 1732,
    that the Peterborough river Nen would willingly discharge itself into
    Whitlesea mere, and so to the Ouse at Lyn, if it were not hindered by
    the sluice at Horsey bridge by the river Nen. I see no difficulty to
    attribute the reason of it to the rotation of the globe. Those that
    have gone about to demonstrate to us that famous problem of the earth’s
    motion, have found out many mathematical and abstracted proofs for
    that purpose, but neglected this which is most sensible and before our
    eyes every minute. It is a property of matter, that when whirled round
    upon an <em>axis</em>, it endeavours to fly from the <em>axis</em>, as we
    see in the motion of a wheel, the dirt and loose parts are thrown the
    contrary way in a tangent line. This is owing to the natural inactivity
    of matter, which is not easily susceptible of motion. Now at the time
    that the body of the earth was in a mixt state between solid and fluid,
    before its present form of land and sea was perfectly determined, the
    almighty Artist gave it its great diurnal motion. By this means the
    elevated parts or mountainous tracts, as they consolidated whilst yet
    soft and yielding, flew somewhat westward, and spread forth a long
    declivity to the east: the same is to be said of the plains, their
    natural descent tending that way, and, as I doubt not, of the superfice
    of the earth below the ocean. This critical minute is sublimely
    described by the admirable poet and observer of nature,</p>

  <p class="noindent">The truth of this observation I have seen universally confirmed in all
    my travels, and innumerable instances of it will occur to the reader
    throughout these discourses. I design another time professedly to
    treat of it in a philosophical way. But consequent to this doctrine it
    is that we have so large a quantity of this marshland in the middle
    of the eastern shore of England, seeming as if made by the washings
    and <em>eluvies</em> of the many rivers that fall that way, such as the
    Welland, the Witham, the Nen, the Ouse great and little, together
    with many other streams of inferior note. These all empty themselves
    into the great bay formed between the Lincolnshire wolds and cliffs
    of Norfolk, called by Ptolemy <i lang="la">Mentaris æstuarium</i>, as rightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
    corrected by Mr. Baxter, seeing it is composed of the mouths of so
    many rivers; <em>Ment</em>, or <em>Mant</em>, signifying <em>ostium</em> in
    the British language. Beside the great quantity of high and inland
    country that discharges its waters this way, even as far as Fritwell
    in Oxfordshire; all the level country lies before it, extending itself
    from within some few miles of Cambridge south, to Keal hills near
    Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire north, about sixty miles long, known by the
    names of the Isle of Ely, Holland and Marshland. This country, since
    the flood, I believe was much in the same state as at present, and for
    its bulk the richest spot of ground in the kingdom; once well inhabited
    by gentry, especially the religious. I apprehend the more inland part
    of it, the Isle of Ely, Deeping Fen, &amp;c. was not in distant ages in so
    bad a condition as now, because the natural drainage of it was better,
    before the sea had by degrees added so much solid ground upon the
    coasts.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Holland</span>, <i>its name</i>.</div>

  <p>In this country I have observed abundance of old Welsh words left among
    us; and I am persuaded that the name of Holland is derived from that
    language, though now terminated by a later word, as is frequent enough.
    It signifies no more than salt or marsh land, such as is gained from
    the sea; and to this day we call the marshes adjoining to, and sometime
    overflowed by the sea, <em>salt marshes</em>. Likewise upon the sea shore
    they formerly made salt in great abundance. The hills all along upon
    the sea bank, the remains of such works, are still called salt hills:
    such are at Fleet, Holbech, Gosberton, Wainflet,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> &amp;c. Many names
    of rivers and roads, thence derived, remain still, such as Salters
    Lode, Salteney Gate, &amp;c. <em>Hallt</em> in the British is <em>salsus</em>,
    salt, as ἅλς in the Greek is <em>mare</em>, the sea; and most evidently
    borrowed from the British, because of its most notorious quality. The
    adjoining part of this country in Norfolk, is called marsh land, in the
    very same sense: so is Zeland and Holland at the mouth of the Rhine,
    where our Cimbric ancestors once lived. In the Cimbric Chersoness, now
    Denmark, is Halland, a division of the country by the Saxons called
    <em>Halgo land</em>. Vid. Spelman’s Glassary, voce <em>Sciringes heal</em>.
    Holsatia, Holstein, &amp;c. and our Holderness in Yorkshire, must thus be
    understood. Hence the isle of Ely too is denominated, the very word
    <em>heli</em> being <em>salsugo</em> in the British. This, in the most
    antient British times, was as much marsh land as our wapentake of Elho
    is now, which acknowledges the same original; <em>hoe</em> signifying a
    parcel of high ground.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>First Inhabitants the</i> <span class="smcap">Britons</span>.</div>

  <p>We may be assured that this whole country was well inhabited by the
    antient Britons, and that as far as the sea coasts, especially the
    islets and higher parts more free from ordinary inundations of the
    rivers, or though not imbanked above the reach of the spring tides;
    for the nature of this place perfectly answered their gusto, both as
    affording abundant pasturage for their cattle, wherein their chief
    sustenance and employment consisted, and in being so very secure from
    incursion and depredations of war and troublesome neighbours, by the
    difficult fens upon the edge of the high country. Here I have not been
    able to meet with any remains of them, except it be the great quantity
    of <em>tumuli</em>, or barrows, in all these parts; scarce a parish
    without one or more of them. They are generally of a very considerable
    bulk, much too large for Roman; nor has any thing Roman been discovered
    in cutting them through; though, a few years ago, two or three were
    dug quite away near Boston, and another at Frampton, to make brick of,
    or to mend the highways. I guess these were the high places of worship
    among our Cimbrian predecessors, purposely cast up, because there
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>are no natural hills in these parts; and we know antiquity affected
    places of elevation for religious rites. No doubt, some are places
    of sepulture, especially such as are very frequent upon the edges of
    the high countries all around, looking down upon the fens. Hither
    seem to have been carried the remains of great men, whose habitations
    were in the marshy grounds, who chose to be buried upon higher ground
    than where they lived; as is the case all over England; for the
    <em>tumuli</em> are commonly placed upon the brink of hills hanging over
    a valley, where doubtless their dwellings were.</p>

  <p>But when the Romans had made considerable progress in reducing this
    island into the regular form of a province, and began the mighty work
    of laying down the great military ways; then I suppose it was, that
    they cast their eyes upon this fertile and wide-extended plain, and
    projected the draining it. <span class="sidenote"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Hermen Street.</span></span>In the reign of Nero, in all probability,
    they made the <em>Hermen Street</em>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as now called by a Saxon word
    equivalent to the Latin <i lang="la">via militaris</i>. That this was the first,
    seems intimated by the name, in that it has retained κατ’ εξοχην, what
    is but a common appellative of such roads. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LVI.</span>This noble work, taking
    in the whole of it, was intended to be a meridian line running from
    the southern ocean, through London, to the utmost bounds of Scotland.
    This may be inferred from the main of it, which runs directly north
    and south. And another argument of its early date, drawn from three
    remarkable particularities, I have observed in travelling upon it,
    and which show it was begun before that notable people had a thorough
    knowledge of the geography of the island. One is, its deviation
    westward as it advances towards these fens from London: another is,
    the new branch, drawn a little beyond Lincoln westward into Yorkshire,
    out of the principal stem going to the Humber: a third is, that it is
    double in Lincolnshire. Of these I shall speak again when we come to
    the following <em>Iter Romanum</em>. Now we will only consider such part
    of it as has relation to the country we are upon; and that is the road
    going from Caster by Peterburgh to Sleford in this county, which is
    undoubtedly Roman, and which first occasioned the draining this fenny
    tract, and surely more antient than that which goes above Stanford,
    and along the heathy part of the county to Lincoln. My reasoning
    depends upon the manner of the road itself, and upon that other great
    work which accompanies it, called the <em>Cardike</em>, equally to be
    ascribed to the same authors. This road is nearer the first intention
    of a meridian line than the other: but, when they found it carried them
    through a low country, where it perpetually needed reparation, and that
    they must necessarily decline westward to reach Lincoln, they quitted
    it, and struck out a new one, more westerly, that should run altogether
    upon better ground. This, if we have leave to guess, was done after
    the time of Lollius Urbicus, lieutenant under Antoninus Pius, who with
    great industry and courage had extended and secured the whole province
    as far as Edinburgh. Then it was they had time and opportunity to
    complete the work in the best manner, being perfect masters of the
    country, and of its geography: and this road was for the ready march of
    their armies and provisions to succour those northern frontiers. But it
    seems as if they had long before that time brought the Hermen Street
    as far as Lincolnshire,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> especially that eastern branch, or original
    stem, of which we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>are treating, and that as early as the reign
    of Nero, and at the same time made the Cardike. I shall give you my
    further reasons for this conjecture, and nothing more than conjecture
    can be expected in such matters.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>Old</i> <span class="smcap">Hermen Street</span>.</div>

  <p>The road which we suppose the original stem of the Hermen Street
    goes in a direct line, and full north and south from Durobrivæ, or
    Caster, to Sleford; and there, for aught I know, it terminates. It is
    manifest, that if it had been carried further in that direction, it
    would have passed below Lincoln heath, and arrive at the river where
    it is not fordable. It parts from the present and real Hermen Street
    at Upton, a mile north of Caster; but this is continued in a strait
    line, which demonstrates that it is the original one: the other goes
    from it with an angular branching. This traverses the river Welland at
    Westdeeping, and is carried in a high bank across the watery meadows
    of Lolham bridges.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These are numerous and large arches made upon
    the road, to let the waters pass through, taken notice of by the great
    Camden as of antiquity; and no doubt originally Roman: then it crosses
    the Glen at Catebridge, (whereabouts it is now called King’sgate,
    <em>via regia</em>) to Bourn, (where Roman coins are often found, many
    in possession of Jos. Banks, jun. esq.) so to Fokingham and Sleaford.
    It is now called Longdike. All along parallel to this road runs a
    famous old drain, called <span class="sidenote"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Cardike</span>.</span>
    <em>Cardike</em>.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Mr. Morton has been very
    curious in tracing it out through his county, Northamptonshire. I am
    sorry I have not yet had opportunity to pursue his laudable example,
    in finishing the course of it through Lincolnshire: but as far as I
    have observed it, it is marked in the map. This is a vast artificial
    canal drawn north and south upon the edge of the fens, from Peterburgh
    river to Lincoln river, about fifty mile long, and by the Romans
    without all peradventure. It is taken notice of by serjeant Callis,
    our countryman, in his readings on the sewers. That wise people, with
    a greatness of thought peculiar to themselves, observed the great use
    of such a channel, that by water carriage should open an inland traffic
    between their two great colonies of Durobrivæ and Lindum, or Lincoln,
    without going round the hazardous voyage of the Estuary: just such was
    the policy of Corbulo in Tacitus, Annal. xi. <i lang="la">Ne tamen miles otium
    indueret inter Mosam Rhenumque trium &amp; viginti millium spatio fossam
    produxit, qua incerta oceani evitarentur.</i> And lest the soldiery
    should be idle, he drew a dike for the space of three and twenty miles
    between the Maese and the Rhine, whereby the dangers of the ocean are
    avoided; which is exactly a parallel case with ours. Besides, it is
    plain that by intercepting all the little streams coming down from
    the high country, and naturally overflowing our levels, it would much
    facilitate the draining thereof, which at this time they must have had
    in view. This canal enters Lincolnshire at Eastdeeping, proceeding
    upon an exact level, which it takes industriously between the high and
    low grounds all the way, by Langtoft and Baston: passing the river
    Glen at Highbridge, it runs in an uninterrupted course as far as
    Kyme: beyond that I have not yet followed it; but I suppose it meets
    Lincoln river near Washenburgh, and where probably they had a fort
    to secure the navigation, as upon other proper intermediate places,
    such <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>as Walcot, Garick, Billingborough, Waldram-hall, Narborough,
    Eye antiently Ege, <em>agger</em>; and I imagine St. Peter’s de Burgo
    hence owes its original: and a place called Low there, a camp ditched
    about, just where the Cardike begins on one side the river: another
    such fortification at Horsey bridge on the other side the river: all
    these names point out some antient works. It is all the way threescore
    foot broad, having a large flat bank, on both sides, for the horses
    that drew their boats. Roman coins are frequently found through its
    whole length, as you well know, who are possessed of many of them of
    different emperors. Now it seems to me highly probable that Catus
    Decianus, the procurator in Nero’s time, was the projector both of this
    road and this canal, two notable examples in different kinds of Roman
    industry and judgment; and the memorial of the author of so great a
    benefit to the country is handed down to us in several particulars; as
    that of Catesbridge before mentioned upon the road, and of Catwater, a
    stream derived from this artificial channel, at the very place where
    it begins, to the Nen at Dovesdale bar: likewise at Dovesdale bar
    comes in another stream from the north, from a place by Shephey bank,
    called Catscove corner; and this was first hinted to me by our deceased
    friend, the learned and reverend Mr. John Britain, late schoolmaster
    of Holbech: to which we may add Catley, a town near Walcot upon the
    Cardike beyond Kyme; and Catthorp, a village near Stanfield, upon the
    road. We may likewise upon the same grounds conjecture that Lollius
    Urbicus repaired this work; whence it seems that his name, though
    corrupted, is preserved in Lolham bridges; for there is no town of that
    kind near it. Vid. Gale’s <cite>Itinerar.</cite> pag. 28. Lowlsworth upon the
    Hermen Street without Bishops-Gate, in Spittle-Fields. Certainly this
    is a good hint for our imitation, had we a like public spirit. Now this
    road thus accompanying the canal, was of great service to the traders,
    who might have an eye upon their vessels all the while. And even after
    the projection of the other branch which goes to Lincoln upon the
    higher ground, the navigation here was undoubtedly continued in full
    perfection, till the Romans left the island; for such is its advantage
    of situation, that it could never want water, nor ever overflow: that
    stream of Catwater seems to be cut on purpose, at least scoured up,
    to preserve these uses in drawing off the floods of Peterburgh river
    into the Nen, if its proper channel was not sufficient. The meaning of
    the word <em>Cardike</em> is no more than Fendike: we use the word still
    in this country, to signify watery, boggy places: it is of British
    original.</p>

  <p>I doubt not but that the Romans likewise made that other cut, between
    Lincoln river and the Trent, called the Foss: the name seems to
    indicate it, as well as the thing itself; for it is but a consequent of
    the Cardike, and formed on the same idea: so that I suppose it was not
    originally cut, but scoured by Henry I. as Hoveden mentions: then the
    navigation was continued by land from Peterborough quite to York, and
    this was very useful to the Romans in their northern wars. The other
    way they might come from Huntingdon.</p>

  <p>The 20th of October, 1726, I traced the Cardike round the out-skirts of
    Sir William Ellys’s park of Nockton: it runs near the site of the old
    priory, whose ruins are just visible: it bounds the park entirely on
    the fen side, and is very perfect thereabouts; the high-country streams
    from Dunston, and others, running along it. We saw where it crossed a
    marshy valley, and reached the opposite high ground in its course to
    Washenburgh. A well of the old priory is well preserved, remarkably
    good water.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

  <p>That part of the Cardike between Lincoln and the Trent was begun to be
    cleansed by bishop Atwater, but he died before completed. It is highly
    probable that the Romans called our Cardike <em>Fossa</em>, which happens
    to be preserved only on that part between Lincoln and the Trent.</p>

  <p>The Fossdike in being in Edward the Confessor’s time. Vide Camden,
    <cite>Nottingham</cite>.</p>

  <p>Cardike runs close by Thurlby town end.</p>

  <p>The marquis of Lindsey gave me an exceeding fair Maximinus; the
    reverse, <span class="allsmcap">GENIO POP. ROM.</span> found at Grimsthorp.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tichmus of Stamford told me she once had many Roman coins, from a
    great parcel found at or near Sleford.</p>

  <p>The 18th of October, 1728, I travelled on the Roman road, the eastern
    branch of the Hermen Street from Sleford, for about three miles
    southward. I observed that it went not to Sleford town directly, but to
    the old house of Sir Robert Carr’s, formerly Lord Hussey’s (attainted
    for treason in time of Henry VIII.) called Old Place. We saw by the
    way, on the east side the road, a mile or more south of Sleford, an old
    work, square, ditched about, large, with an entry from the road; the
    earth of the vallum thrown on both sides.</p>

  <p>But it was not enough for the Romans thus to provide for commerce
    and travelling, without they set proper stations or mansions for the
    reception of negociators and the like. Accordingly we find the distance
    between Caster and Lincoln, about 40 miles, has two towns upon it at
    proper intervals for lodging; these are Sleaford and Stanfield: the
    original names of them are in irrecoverable silence, but the eternity
    of the Romans is inherent. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sleaford</span> Ro. <i>town</i>.</span>At Sleaford they have found many Roman
    coins, especially of the Constantine family and their wives, about the
    castle and the spring-head a little above the town. It is probable that
    Alexander, the bishop of Lincoln, built his work upon the site of a
    Roman citadel. Beside, at Sleaford comes in the other Roman road from
    the fen country by Brig-end causeway, and at the intersection of these
    two roads the old town stood. At Stanfield,<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Stanfield</span> Ro. <i>town</i>.</span> which is a little village
    near Burn, they find daily the foundations of buildings, innumerable
    coins and other antiquities, of which yourself and our friend Mr. John
    Hardy have a good quantity. These are chiefly dug up in a close called
    Blackfield, from the extraordinary richness of the ground. It stands
    half a mile off the road upon elevated ground, whence you may see
    Spalding, Boston, and the whole level: it is now only of some note for
    a good chalybeat spring.</p>

  <p>I shall rehearse a few things I have noted hereabouts, and then we
    will descend into Holland. The following antient part of the genealogy
    of the inheritors of Brun, or Bourn, contains several antiquities
    hereabouts. The spring-head at Bourn, near the castle belonging to
    them, is remarkable for its largeness and quickness.</p>

  <p>There were other collateral branches of this family about 1244. such as
    Thomas Wake, who held lands in Stoke and Irthingbure under the abbot
    of Peterburgh. Wydo Wac held half a knight’s fee in Deping, Beresham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
    and Stow, of the heirs of Hugh Wake the same year. Hugo Wac, Roger Wac,

  <p>Not long since some British instruments of brass called celts,
    arrow-heads, and bits of bridles of the same metal, were found at Aye
    near the Cardike. The 19th of November, 1731, I saw four celts and a
    brass spear-head found at Ege, or Aye: the celts were of the female
    or recipient kind: they were bought by bishop Kennet, and are now in
    the gentlemen’s society at Peterborough. The Druids buried them there,
    when the Romans drove them northward: there has been some great work
    of the Druids there, as I take it. At Jernham was found an old brass
    seal, a man blowing a horn, the legend <cite>John de Sodeburi</cite>, now in
    the hands of Mr. Richards of Stanford. At Edenham was a stone cross
    now demolished: the inscription on it I have inserted in the <span class="sidenote">TAB. XI.</span>Plate of
    Crosses: I saw the stump of it remaining not long since: hard by has
    been an old castle at Bitham. Grimsthorp, the pleasant seat of the
    Duke of Ancaster: the park is very large and beautiful; in the middle
    of it stood Vaudy abbey in a vale, founded by Wil. de Albemarle 1147.

    horse-race, is extremely delightful.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In Hakunby church upon a stone

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Holland</span> <i>imbanked by the</i> Romans.</div>

  <p>Having given an account of the preparation made by the Romans towards
    gaining this vast tract of fen-land, the Lincolnshire levels, by
    securing it from the fresh water of the high countries in that noble
    cut called Cardike; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>we must imagine their next care was to render
    it safe from the flux of the Ocean, by making a great bank all along
    upon the sea coasts: this was done as to the wapentake of Elho by what
    we call the Old Sea-dike, which by the people at this day is said to
    be made by Julius Cæsar and his soldiers; as if they had knowledge
    of its being a Roman work: at the mouths of all the rivers no doubt
    they made gotes and sluices as at present, which was an invention of
    Osiris, the great king of Egypt, as Diodorus Siculus tells us, I. 19.
    We may well suppose it was performed after the time of Lollius Urbicus,
    scarce fully accomplished before: possibly in Severus his time, which
    seems not obscurely hinted at by Herodian, III. <i lang="la">Sed in primis curæ

    natant excursantque ad ilia usque demersi.</i> But he had it in his
    particular care to make passes over the fens, that the soldiers might
    stand firm and fight upon hard ground; for many places in Britain are
    marshy through the frequent overflowings of the ocean, over which the
    inhabitants will swim, and walk though up to the middle in water. To
    which description no place so well corresponds.</p>

  <p>That the Romans thoroughly inhabited this fertile plain, the
    following instances will sufficiently evince. About 1713, at Elm near
    Wisbech, an urn full of Roman brass money was taken up, not far from
    a <em>tumulus</em> of which the common people have strange notions,
    affirming that they frequently see a light upon it in dark winter
    nights. Dr. Massey has many of the coins; they are of the later
    empire. There is another piece of high ground near it, where have been
    buildings. Dr. Massey says there is a Roman altar in a wall there. At
    Gedney hill several Roman coins have been found; some of Antoninus are
    in your collection. In the same hamlet, about two mile north of Southea
    bank, is a pasture called the High Doles, being a square doubly moted,
    where ancient foundations have been dug up, and some Roman coins.
    Another like square so moted is in the parish of St. Edmund’s, about
    the same distance from the said bank, where the like matters have been
    discovered. Aswic grange in Whaplodedrove parish is a high piece of
    ground, square and moted about: in this and near it many Roman coins
    have been dug up, and urns, which I have seen; some coins in your
    collection. This is near Catscove corner; and it was Mr. Britain’s
    notion that Catus made this work among many others as <em>castella</em>
    to secure the possession of the country: these lie as it were in a
    line, on the most southerly part of Elho. In the parish of Fleet near
    Ravensclow, about 1698,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> upon a piece of high ground where buildings
    have been, Mr. Edward Lenton dug up a large urn with letters round it,
    full of Roman coins,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> about the quantity of three pecks, covered
    with an oak board: the urn he broke in pieces: they were of brass piled
    edgeways, mostly about the time of Gallienus and the thirty tyrants as
    called, Tetricus, Claudius Gothicus, Victorinus, Carausius, Alectus,
    &amp;c. I have seen vast numbers of them, and have some by me: many are in
    your collection. Near this place runs a low channel, quite to Fleet
    haven, which probably then was the chief outlet of the waters into
    the sea. Mr. Lenton found some ship-timber upon it with rusty nails,
    probably of some Roman barge. None of these coins were lower than the
    Tetrici, which proves the imbankation was made before their time. In
    the same latitude, and in the next parish, Holbech,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in a pasture
    called Anytofts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> in my tenure, is a like square of high ground, where
    rubbish of buildings and coins have been found; it is moted likewise:
    not long since a labourer, scouring up a pit in the mote, took up an
    urn now in my possession. At Giggleshurn, in casting up a ditch, were
    many Roman coins found: we may reasonably conjecture Moulton hall was
    such another place originally: and in a Held not far from thence,
    called Woods, near Ravens-bank, three mile south of Moulton church,
    upon plowing, several Roman urns and vessels were found, of fine white
    and red earth; some of them were brought to Mr. Hardy. At Spalding,
    Roman antiquities have been found, particularly cisterns; of which
    some accounts in the Acts of the Royal Soc. N<sup>o</sup> 279. and there was a
    Roman castle there, as I conjecture, on the north side of the town, not
    far from the river on the right hand of the great road to Bolton, the
    square form of the ditch yet remaining. These places, with some other
    of like nature, make another line of fortresses through the middle of
    the country, parallel to the present towns. I have been told that at
    Theophilus Grant’s house in Whaplode, near Gorham’s holt, aqueducts
    of clay, one let into another, have been dug up;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and that in the
    seadike bank, between Fleet and Gedney, a brass sword was lately found,
    which seem to be Roman. Thus far in South Holland. At Boston, about
    1716, they dug up an old Roman foundation beyond the school-house: near
    it some hewn stones formed a cavity, in which was an urn with ashes,
    another little pot with an ear, and an iron key of an odd figure, in
    my possession. Some time before then, in Mr. Brown’s garden at the
    Green poles, they dug up an urn lined with thin lead full of red earth
    and bones. A like one I have seen now in Sir Hans Sloan’s museum,
    unquestionably Roman.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Roman</span> <i>roads there</i>.</div>

  <p>As the Romans had thus intirely taken in and inhabited the country, no
    doubt but according to their custom they drew several roads across it:
    but I fear it will be very difficult to give an exact account of them:
    such is the nature of the ground, having no solid materials, that they
    would be presently wore away without more constant reparations than the
    inhabitants practise: yet I have little doubt in supposing one of their
    ways was drawn from the northern high country about Bolingbroke by
    Stickford, Stickney, Sibsey, and so to Boston river about Redstonegote,
    where it passed it by a ferry. I have fancied to myself that several
    parcels of it are plainly Roman, by the straitness and by the gravelly
    bottom: from thence to Kirkton it is indubitably so, being laid with a
    very large bed of gravel: and just a mile from the river is a stone,
    now called the Mile-stone, standing in a <i lang="la">quadrivium</i>; it is
    a large round stone like the <i lang="la">frustum</i> of a pillar, and very
    properly a <i lang="la">lapis milliaris</i>. From Kirkton I imagine the road went
    to Donington, where it met the great and principal road of the country,
    which is drawn from Ely to Sleaford in a line not much different from a
    strait one. It is certain that there is such a road from Grantchester,
    which was a Roman town a mile above Cambridge, to Ely by Stretham:
    thence another goes across the depth of the fens by Upwell and Elme
    towards Wisbech; and it was near this road that the urn with coins
    first mentioned was found: and anno 1730 a Roman urn full of coins
    was found at the same place; they were of silver, and very fair. Mr.
    Beaupre Bell, a curious gentleman, has many Roman coins found near this
    Roman road by Emney; several of Carausius undescribed. Wisbech probably
    was a Roman station, and their castle founded upon an older foundation.
    I suppose this road passed over <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>Wisbech river above the town towards
    Guyhurn chapel, then went to Trokenholt and Clowscross, there entering
    our country: from thence that it went in a strait line to Spalding, by
    which means most of those square forts we have mentioned in Elho, where
    Roman antiquities were discovered, together with most of the southern
    hamlets, will be found to be situate near or upon it; such as St.
    Edmund’s chapel, the moted place there, Gedneyhill chapel, Highdoles
    there, Holbech chapel, Whaplodedrove chapel, Aswic grange, St.
    Katherine’s, and Moulton chapel: whether any traces of it can now be
    found or no, I cannot say; but the villages thereabouts seem strongly
    to favour the conjecture. Supposing it fact, I should not be surprised
    if it now be laid perfectly level with the surface of this fenny soil,
    seeing I have observed the like appearance of a Roman road when carried
    across a meadow in the high countries, and which was composed of a bed
    of gravel 100 foot broad, particularly at the Roman city of Alauna by
    Bicester, of which I shall in a following page give an account: and
    this of ours I suppose only made of the earth of the country thrown
    into a bank, because it was impossible to get more durable materials.</p>

  <p>From Spalding, according to my sentiments, this road went towards
    Herring bridge (the word retaining some semblance of antiquity) upon
    Surflet river, so along the division between the wapentakes of Kirton
    and Aveland, near Wrigbolt and Cressy-hall, to the end of Brig-end
    causeway at Donington. Here, Holland brig or Brig-end causeway has all
    the requisites that can ascertain it to be a Roman work, being strait
    and laid with a solid bed of stone: the present indeed is repaired
    every year, but we have much reason to think the first projection of it
    through this broad morass was no less than Roman. From thence it went
    to Sleford; then it seems to have gone across the heath, and to have
    fallen in with the great Hermen street at a remarkable place called
    Biard’s leap: from thence possibly it was carried, or was designed to
    be, by Stretleythorp and Brentbroughton over the Witham to Crocolana
    upon the foss-way; then over the Trent into Nottinghamshire, where
    it answers in a line with the road to Tuxford and Worksop; and so on
    perhaps to the Irish sea, whereby it would become a great parallel
    to the Watling street running across the kingdom, as it does, from
    south-east to north-west. At Sleaford I am inclinable to think another
    road came from Banovallum, or Horn castle, to the east of the river
    Bane southward by les Yates, and so crossed the Witham by Chapelhill
    and the Cardike somewhere about Kyme: or else crossed the Witham at the
    Hermitage, so went by Swinshed north end to Donington: this principal
    road we speak of on the other end seems to go from Ely by Soham and
    Bury to the German ocean. I am not ashamed to offer my conjecture to
    the curious, however slender its foundation may be, if only as a hint
    for a future search: but it seems to me very probable, that if it
    was not fully executed by the Romans, they intended it, and have in
    part manifestly done it. I conceit it crosses the Icening street at
    Ikesworth near Bury, then goes to Bretenham, the Combretonium; but with
    that country of Suffolk I am at present perfectly unacquainted. Return
    we to Holland.</p>

  <p>Besides this great road, I think we need not scruple to assert that
    now called Ravensbank to be another, going east and west, through the
    heart of the country, from Tid St. Mary’s to Cowbit. I have rode some
    miles upon it, where it is now extremely strait and broad. We have
    been informed that it is actually in some old writings called Romans
    Bank: it is well known the Welsh pronounced Roman <em>Rhuffain</em>, and
    our English word <em>ruffian</em> is from this fountain. Among the Welsh
    the letters <em>m</em> and <em>v</em> are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> equivalent, to which <em>f</em>
    is perfectly alike: <em>maur</em> and <em>vaur</em> is great, and many
    more: so that <em>Roman</em>, <em>raven</em>, and <em>ruffen</em>, is the
    same word; and hence no doubt came <em>rambling</em>, <em>roving</em>,
    and <em>roming</em>, as an ignominious appellative of such as thought
    every country better than their own; for such to our ancestors seemed
    the Romans, that scarce left any corner of the known world impervious
    to their all-conquering eagles, carrying arts and arms along with
    them as an impetuous torrent, with a most glorious and invincible
    perseverance. Further, it is not unlikely that the upper road running
    east and west nearer the sea bank, now called Old Spalding gate, is
    originally Roman: in some places, as about Fleet, it retains the name
    of Haregate, which is equivalent to <i lang="la">via militaris</i> when spoken
    by our Saxon progenitors. Thus the main road and these two lesser
    ones seem sufficiently to answer this purpose as to Elho: it seems to
    me, that when the Romans made the many forts all along the eastern
    shore, to guard against the Saxons, that this bay was provided for
    by five, two upon the edges of the high country, and three upon the
    rivers; Brancaster in Norfolk, Burgh on Lincolnshire side; Wisbech,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
    Spalding, and Boston, upon each river of the fenny tract.</p>

  <p>Having given you then all the authentic or conjectural memoirs that
    have in general occurred to my reflection upon the most ancient state
    of this country, I shall proceed to other particularities, nearer
    our own times, through every parish; only first take notice in short
    of a wonderful appearance in nature all over this country, and which
    is common to all such like upon the globe, as far as my informations
    reach: that is, <span class="sidenote"><i>Antediluvian trees.</i></span>the infinite quantities of subterraneous trees, lying
    three or four foot deep, of vast bulk and different species, chiefly
    fir and oak, exceeding hard, heavy and black: many times the branches
    reach so near day as to break their ploughs, for so I have heard
    them complain about Crowland: about Kyme and Billingay they have dug
    up some boats or canoos made of hollowed trunks of trees.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Many
    people will think that this is nothing but the effect of particular
    floods, and that this country was once a forest, and not long since
    disafforested. This country was once taken into the forest of Kesteven
    by the Norman kings, (as you have told me) only with a political view
    of extending their power, and disafforested soon after at the instance
    of the prior of Spalding: yet it is true of Nassaburg hundred only,
    in Northamptonshire. But in my apprehension, as to the matter before
    us, such confine their notions to very scanty bounds: an universal
    phænomenon requires a more dilated solution, and no less than that
    of the Noachian deluge. But upon this I hope for an occasion to
    be more copious another time: at present I remember a passage in
    Pausanias’s <cite>Attics</cite> toward the end; speaking of an ebeny statue
    of Archigetes, “I have heard, (says he) from a man of Cyprus very
    skilful in medicinal herbs, that ebeny bears no leaves, no fruit, nor
    has it any stock exposed to the sun, only roots in the earth, which the
    Ethiopians dig up. Some of them are particularly skilful in finding
    them out.” I doubt not but our author speaks of subterranean trees, and
    that our people might use this timber to better use than burning it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

  <p>Most writers, and particularly Mr. Camden, and most strangers, have an
    injurious opinion of this country, and apply that to the whole which
    is true but of part of it: for in the main the land is admirably good,
    hard, and dry; produces excellent corn and grass; feeds innumerable
    sheep and oxen of a very large size, and good flesh and wool; bears
    wood extremely well, has several large woods in it, some intirely of
    oak of considerable size; is full of hedge-rows and quicksets, and
    in summer time looks like the garden of Eden: it is level, and most
    delightful to travellers, whether on horseback, or in a coach. The air
    indeed is moist, as being near the sea, and bordering upon the fens
    of the isle of Ely: as to the first, it is the same upon every sea
    coast; as to the latter, they are chiefly on the south side, whence
    the sun for the most part draws off the vapours from this country.
    Indeed this inconvenience accrues from such vicinity, the production
    of gnats; to which Angelus Politianus has done so much honour in that
    beautiful Greek epigram you showed me; and is well guarded against
    by the gentry in the use of netted canopies hung round their beds,
    which was an invention of the Ægyptians living in a like country.
    Vide Brown’s Garden of Cyrus, p. 30. But all things necessary for the
    comfort of life are here in great plenty; and visitants ever go away
    with a better opinion of it than they bring. That great soul king
    Charles I. himself undertaking the glorious talk, and others under him,
    had projected and made such stately works of <em>sewers</em>, as would
    have rendered this country before now, for trade and beauty, the rival
    of its name-sake beyond sea; but the licentious times that succeeded,
    gave the unthinking mob (incited by his avowed adversary in all things,
    Cromwell) an opportunity to destroy them. I have often considered and
    admired the length, breadth, and depth of their canals, the vastness of
    their gotes and sluices: indeed I think they made many more than were
    useful, and might have laid out the whole in a better manner. I would
    not, like the Trojan Prophetess, prognosticate ill to my own country;
    but it is not difficult to foresee, that unless some project be taken
    in hand, like that which my friend Mr. Kinderley published some time
    ago, this vast and rich tract must be abandoned to eels and wild ducks.
    A thing of this nature is not to be done but by the senate of the
    kingdom taking the matter intirely into their own hands; and if I have
    any judgement, whatever new works are made, ought always to be carried
    eastward only, for reasons I inculcated before: therefore, instead of
    deriving the Welland into the Witham, as was his notion, I would have
    it brought to the Nen, and both into the Ouse at Lynn, as it was in its
    original and natural state.</p>

  <p>Since the time of the Romans, beyond their first bank have been many
    intakes, by successive banks, of the best ground in the world left
    by the sea, which contracts its own limits by throwing up banks of
    sand out of the estuary: so that, from time to time, the land-owners
    upon these frontiers gain several thousands of acres. It is observed,
    the land so imbanked is ever higher in level than that left behind
    it; and I doubt not but some time the whole bay between Lincolnshire
    and Norfolk (being one of our great sovereign’s noblest chambers in
    his British dominions over the sea, vide Seld. <cite>Mar. claus.</cite>)
    will become dry land. By this means the parishes hereabouts increase
    to a huge bulk. Holbech from Dovesdale bar, where it joins to
    Cambridgeshire, to the limits of the salt marshes, is near twenty miles
    long. The cattle bred on this ground are very large; the sheep never
    have horns. Smithfield market, as now much supported, was chiefly set
    up by the inhabitants here, as I have been told, particularly by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> Mr.
    William Hobson, brother to the famous Cambridge carrier, and Mr. Cust;
    the London butchers, before then, commonly going into the country to
    buy cattle.</p>

  <p>In every parish formerly were many chapels, it being impracticable
    for people to come so far to one church, though now most of them
    are demolished, at what time I cannot imagine. No part of England
    boasts of so many beautiful churches, having generally lofty spires
    of fine squared stone, fetched from Barneck pits, which are a coarse
    rag full of petrified shells of all kinds of small fish, and not, as
    some think, from Norway. And in no very distant times, not a parish
    without great numbers of gentry, lords, knights, and great families,
    who made a figure in the world: now scarce any remains of them, but
    the site of their houses moted round, their tombs in the churches,
    their arms in the painted windows, where they have by chance escaped
    the fury of fanatic zeal. Many religious houses formerly there; and
    nearly the whole country was got into their hands, as appears by the
    old terriers, or town-books. The only houses of note are at present
    Dunton hall, in Tyd St. Mary’s parish, lately rebuilt magnificently
    by Sigismund Trafford, esq. who has likewise inclosed a considerable
    park with a brick wall; and Cressy hall in Surflet parish, the seat
    of Henry Heron, esq. in which the lady Margaret, mother to Hen. VII.
    was once entertained. The house was handsomely rebuilt by the present
    possessor’s father, Sir Henry Heron, knight of the Bath; but the chapel
    is old, built, or licensed at least, anno 1309, as an inscription over
    the door tells us. In it is an old brass eagle with an inscription
    round it.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

  <p>Formerly, there is reason to suppose, the gentry had many parks
    near their seats. Records in your possession show that the prior of
    Spalding, about 1265, compelled Thomas lord Moulton to compound with
    him for the venison in his park at Moulton; and in Holbech, about a
    mile south of the church, are lands in my tenure, called the Park. That
    fish and fowl is here plentiful, no one will wonder; but particularly
    the pigeons are noted for large and fine.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>Decoys.</i></div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. II.</div>

  <p>In the out-skirts of it are great numbers of decoys, places so called
    where they take an incredible quantity of wild ducks,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> mostly sent
    up to London: they are large pits dug in the fens, with five canals
    shooting from them, each ending in a point after one angle made, well
    planted with willows, fallows, osiers, and such underwood. I have given
    a drawing of one. The method of catching fowl in short is this: the
    decoy-man coming down to the angle of the pipe, or canal, which is
    covered with nets and over-shadowed with trees, peeps through the holes
    in the reedy sheds, disposed like the scenes at the play-house, and
    joined by the others with holes at the bottom, about as high as a man’s
    breast: when he sees a sufficient quantity of wild ducks in the mouth
    of the great pond, by whistling softly, the tame ducks wing-stocked,
    and brought up for that purpose, swim into the pipe covered with the
    nets, to feed upon the corn he throws over the sheds into the water:
    this tempts the wild ducks in to partake of the bait: in the mean time
    a dog they teach runs round the half-sheds, in and out at the holes in
    the bottom, which amuses the fowl so that they apprehend no danger:
    when he has brought them far enough into the pipe, stooping he goes
    along the scenes, till he is got beyond the ducks, and rising up shows
    himself at the half-scenes, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>which frightens the wild ducks only, the
    opposite way into the narrow end of the pipe, which terminates in a
    fatal net: and all this is done without any noise or knowledge of the
    rest of the wild ducks in the great pond; so that the decoy-man having
    dispatched one pipe, goes round to execute the same game at all the
    rest, whereby infinite quantities are catched in a year’s time at one
    of these places only.</p>

  <p>In running over what few remarkables I have observed in this country,
    I shall exclude Marsh-land, because in Norfolk, observing only that
    their churches are very beautiful, numerous, large, and stately; that
    here are, too, many such of the <em>tumuli</em>. You will indulge me the
    liberty of giving the etymology of places all along: Cicero likes that
    method; <cite>Acad. Quæst.</cite> 1. 8. <i lang="la">verborum explicatio probatur</i>,
    i. e. <i lang="la">qua de causa quæque essent ita nominata quam etymologiam
    appellabant</i>: and though there be often more of pleasant subtlety
    than reality in such matters, yet it serves to find out and preserve
    some old words in a language that otherwise are in danger of oblivion.
    <span class="sidenote"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Washes</span>.</span>
    I shall begin with the Washes so much talked of, and so terrible to
    strangers, though without much reason; if they take a guide, which
    is highly adviseable. The meaning is this: they are the mouths of
    the river Welland, called Fossdike Wash, and the river Ouse, called
    Cross-Keys Wash, running into the sea, and inclosing this country
    almost round. <em>Wase Sax. lutum, oose.</em> Twice in a day, six hours
    each time during the recess of the tide, they are fordable and easy
    to be passed over: the intermediate six hours they are covered with
    the flux of the ocean. Mr. Merret, of Boston, son to Dr. Merret, has
    given a table in the Philos. Trans. which I improved for the benefit
    of travellers, and is graven on a handsome copperplate by my friend,
    Mr. John Redman: but I would have passengers not to trust too far to
    the minutes in the table, because at some times of the year the tides
    will anticipate a few minutes, at others will be retarded, and at all
    times (not to say any thing of the difference of clocks and watches)
    south-east winds make the tides flow earlier than ordinary, north-west
    protract them; so that a wise traveller, in this and all other cases,
    will take time and tide by the forelock. Formerly people travelled what
    they call the Long Wash, between Lynn and Boston, intirely upon the
    sands or skirts of the ocean, but now quite disused and impracticable:
    there it was, that king John lost all his carriages among the creeks
    and quicksands. The memory of it is retained to this day, by the corner
    of a bank between Cross-Keys Wash and Lynn, called now King’s Corner.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Lutton.</div>

  <p>In Lutton was born the famous Dr. Busby, master of Westminster school,
    who has beautified the church, and founded a school there: he owes his
    education to the Welbys, an ancient family in this country. I suppose
    the town has its name from the general drainage of the country, which
    was here in one channel united: they call such Lades, or Lodes, to this
    day: this probably is as ancient as any town in Holland. South from
    it (and therefore)<span class="sidenote smcap">Sutton.</span> Sutton church is of an ancient make, especially
    the stone work of the steeple: the upper part of the church has been
    built of brick in the memory of man. John of Gaunt owned Sutton, and
    other vast manors and townships in this country. At Tyd St. Giles,
    Nicholas Breakspear was curate, who afterwards became pope Adrian IV.
    St. James’s chapel is built of a large sort of brick, such as I have
    seen no where else; not Roman.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XI.</span> Near it is Ivy-Cross, of stone, in a
    <i lang="la">quadrivium</i>; a curious piece, upon Ravensbank.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Gedney.</div>

  <p>Gedney church is very beautiful, built, I believe, chiefly by the
    abbots of Croyland, who had a house, no doubt, very stately, on the
    north side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> of the church, and large possessions in the parish: the
    upper part of the tower is of the same date with the church, built
    upon older work; probably both the work of the abbots, together with
    contributions of the rich families that formerly lived here. In the
    chancel window a religious in his habit. There is an old monument of
    the Welbys, and upon the south door is this inscription:</p>

  <p class="noindent">The town seems to be derived from <i lang="la">Gaden-ea, aqua ad viam</i>:
    <em>Ea</em> is a watering place properly for cattle, and roads we still
    call gates in this country.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Fleet.</div>

  <p>The next parish, Fleet, from the Anglo-Saxonic <em>Fleot</em>,
    <em>æstuarium</em>, <em>fluxus</em>, still called Fleet-Haven, is
    remarkable for the steeple standing at a distance from the church: from
    this place the family of the Fletes come, who have made a considerable
    figure in the country ever since we have any written memorials.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Holbech.</div>

  <p>Holbech (the Salt-Beech) church is very large, and well built, a
    strong tower and lofty steeple, dedicate to all saints: formerly there
    were organs and fine painted glass, with many coats of arms, but none
    left except the Holbeches: Vert, six escallops argent, three, two,
    one.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXI.</span> There is a fine monument of the Littleburys, an ancient and
    flourishing family in these parts:<span class="sidenote">TAB. I. 2d Vol.</span> upon his shield is his coat, Argent,
    two lions passant gardant gules: there is a brass inscription of a
    lady of the Welby family, wife to Sir Richard Leake, knight. <span class="antiqua" lang="la">Orate

    Henry Rands, alias de Holbech, bishop of Lincoln, who was one of the
    compilers of the Liturgy: here formerly flourished the ancient families
    of Fleet, Dacres, Harrington, Barrington, Welby, Multon.</p>

  <p>In the year 1696, in digging at Mr. Adlard Stukeley’s gardens, they
    found an old brass seal, which I gave to Sir Hans Sloan; a man in
    long robes, with two escutcheons, on one three cocks, on the other a
    portcullis; the legend, +<span class="allsmcap">SOVRABLA DEUS OLER</span>. In the year 1698,
    an iron spur with a very long shank was found: in my possession. A
    remarkable rarity in nature I met withal, an admirable ossification in
    the <em>omentum</em> of a sheep, white and solid as ivory. Mr. Cheselden
    has printed a cut of it in the second edition of his Anatomy. I gave it
    to Dr. Mead.</p>

  <p>From the ancient churchwardens’ accounts, before the time of the
    Reformation, from anno 1453, many curious remarks may be made, in
    relation to prices of things, wages, superstitious customs, old
    families, and the like: a specimen whereof I have here annexed.</p>

  <p>In 1529, a new organ cost 3l. 6s. 8d. The organ in the church was
    taken down 1568. Anno 1453, Wm. Enot, of Lynn, epi. and Henry Nele of
    Holbech, gave the saints bell. Another guild of St. Thomas; another
    of our Lady. The vestry on the south side of the choir was taken
    down 1567. There was formerly a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary
    at Holbech hurn, near the ancient seat of the Littleburys; standing
    1515: another chapel thereabouts, dedicated to St. Nicholas: another
    in Wignal’s gate, near Holbech hall, by the river side, dedicated to
    St. Peter. About 1719, I saw many corpses dug up in the yard at making
    a ditch there. Another in the fen ends. An ancient guild of Corpus
    Christi stood near Barney pit, where is now a house once belonging to
    Moses Stukeley, who owned the estate thereof. An hospital founded by
    John de Kirkton, in his own messuage, by licence of king Ed. III dat.
    Nov. 16, for a warden, chaplain, and fifteen poor people: he endowed it
    with several lands in Holbech, which he held of the abbot of Croyland,
    who by licence permitted the same to be annexed to this hospital of All
    Saints in Holbech, for which he paid 20l. This stood, as I imagine,
    where now is the Chequer inn, over against the church. I remember the
    old stone-work arched doors and windows with mullions, pulled down
    when rebuilt by my father, and many of the carved stones were laid in
    the foundation of the houses he built by the river side at the bridge.
    See Dugdale’s <cite>Monasticon</cite>. A free-school was founded here, about
    1669, by George Farmer, esq. who endowed it with lands, which with
    others since given are now worth about 50l. per annum; which I am bound
    in gratitude not to forget. A. D. 1699, there were belonging to the
    fifty-four bounds of this parish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
    paying rates, acres 6234; in the marsh, acres 6532; and since added
    for the last intake, acres 170. The old cross in the market-place was
    pulled down 1683. 1253, Thomas de Multon, lord Egremont, obtained
    a market and fair to<span class="sidenote">TAB II. 2d Vol.</span> Holbech, 31 Oct. 37 Hen. III. at Windsor, and
    probably built that cross.</p>

    Croyland: the tower stands on the south side. In the upper and south

    a bend gules, charged with three roses argent; Argent, two lions

  <p>Moulton, or Multon, probably has its name from a mill, which anciently,

    whence the name of this hundred is derived: it is about the middle
    thereof, and was formerly the main road across the country, now called
    Old Spalding Gate. Old men tell us, here was kept in ancient times an
    annual court; I suppose a convention, <i lang="la">sub dio</i>, of the adjacent
    parts, to treat of their general affairs. A wood hard by is called
    Elhostone wood.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Weston.</div>

  <p>Weston, because west from the last town. Here is the stately chapel of
    Wykeham, the villa of the rich priors of Spalding, built by Clement de
    Hatfield, prior, who died anno 1318. In 1051, Spalding priory made by
    Thorold, sheriff of Lincoln, out of his own manor-house. Many places
    near the old sea-bank are called <em>hurns</em>, signifying an angle.
    Here is a little leam called the Wik: Mr. Camden, in <cite>Bucks</cite>,
    says it signifies the winding of a river, as Cowhurn hard by.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Spalding.</div>

  <p>Spalding has been famous for its ancient and rich priory founded before
    the Conquest, and for the residence of Ivo Tailbois, the lord of this
    country, by gift of William the Conqueror, the site of whose castle is
    on the north-east part of the town. The town-hall was built by William
    Hobson. But of this place we expect from you, sir, a more particular
    account.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Pynchbek.</div>

  <p>In Pynchbek church-windows are the arms of Ogle, of Fleet; Argent,
    on two bars sable, six escallops of the first, empaled with <em>De la
    Launde</em>. Pyncebeck seems to come from the Cimbrian <em>pinken</em>,
    <em>lucere</em>, from the clearness of its water.</p>

  <p>Many towns, on both sides Deeping Fen, end in <em>ington</em>,
    <em>ingham</em>, as lying upon the Mead. <span class="sidenote smcap">Donington.</span>Donington is very hilly, full of
    elevations or dunes. Thomas Cowley, esq. of Donington, who died about
    1718, left all his estate, which was considerable, to the poor of every
    parish where it lay, whereof 400l. per ann. to Donington, where he
    built a school-house, and endowed it.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Algarkirk.</div>

  <p>Algarkirk has a fine church, in which are some water-bougets carved
    on the oak seats in escutcheons. They say here lived the famous count
    Algar,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> commander of the Holland men in many battles against the
    Danes, of whom they show an image in stone in the church-yard. I found
    there this inscription,</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Wiberton.</div>

  <p>Wiberton, they say, has its name from Guibertus, a great man here
    formerly. There is a place called Multon hall, which belonged to the
    aforementioned Thomas de Multon. Here is likewise Titton hall: the
    chapel is now converted into a stable.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Frampton.</div>

  <p>Hard by is Frampton, probably from the Anglo-Saxonic <em>Faran</em>,
    <em>trajicere</em>: for here they passed over the river in a ferry,
    before Boston bridge was built; as at Framton, in Gloucestershire,
    upon the Severn, and Framilode passage. Farnton by Newark, where
    now is the ferry over the Trent. Gosberton, from <em>Gosbèrt</em>, or
    <em>Gosbright</em>, I suppose lord of the town before <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>the Conquest.
    Fossdike seems to be <em>Fordsdike</em>, where we pass over the Washes.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Skirbeck.</div>

  <p>Skirebec doubtless has its name from the Saxon, <em>scire</em>, division,
    because here the river parts the hundreds. Here was an hospital of
    knights of St. John of Jerusalem, now intirely demolished, though the
    church was standing within memory of man. There was another religious
    house near the church: the remains of it is now the parsonage-house.
    Such names of towns as Fishtoft, Butterwick, Swineshead, Cowbyte, and
    the like, seem easy enough.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Sibsey.</div>

  <p>Sibsey church has very handsome pillars and circular arches, somewhat
    after the Roman mode. The top of the steeple is added upon the old
    work; perhaps from its watery situation; <em>sipan</em>, to steep.
    <span class="sidenote smcap">Leverton.</span>Leverton, <i lang="la">Leofrici oppidum</i>: he was a potent man thereabouts at
    the time of the Normans coming, and gave to the town much common: his
    deed of gift is now in possession of the reverend and worthy vicar, Mr.
    William Falkner, which I have seen.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Frieston.</div>

  <p>Frieston, a <em>frith</em>, <em>æstuarium</em>; so Ald Friston in Sussex,
    near Cuckmere haven. Here was an opulent monastery founded by Guy de
    Croun, whose genealogy I shall not think much to recite, because it
    relates to the antiquities of this country, and in some measure shows
    the reason of what my friend Mr. Becket, surgeon, much wondered at
    when he searched the old repository of wills at the Prerogative Office
    in London, where he observed more of this country than any other in
    England.</p>

  <p>The site of Roushall, where the barons Ros lived, is in the parish of Fishtoft.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Vainona.</div>

  <p>In Wainfleet church, the bishop of Winchester, whose name was Patten,
    founder of Magdalen college, Oxford, erected a marble monument for
    his father, where are his coats of arms in the windows. In the town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
    he built a handsome chapel of brick, and endowed it with a pretty
    good revenue, to pray for his and his ancestors souls. Now it is
    made a free-school house. This place still retains its ancient name;
    for I am certain it is the Vainona mentioned by the famous author of
    <cite>Ravenna</cite>, who has happily preserved so many of our old British
    cities. The learned Mr. Baxter, in his Glossary of British Antiquities,
    with a sagacity peculiar to himself, has corrected this from Navione.
    The sea has added much ground to this place since the Roman times, and
    then their city stood higher up by the churches, which is a mile off
    the present town. The haven was near St. Thomas church, now called
    North-holm: it is still very deep thereabouts, and appears to have been
    broad, being a pretty good river, whilst the waters of the east fen
    ran through it, and kept it open: it was thirty foot wide a mile above
    the churches, as appears by the old cloughs there; for they had wisely
    contrived by that means to keep out the salt water and heighten the
    fresh, which no doubt would have preserved the haven to this day, had
    they not foolishly suffered the east-fen water to be carried to Boston.
    It is apparent the natural course of water here (as we before observed
    of other parts of the level) is eastward: the east fen is lower than
    the west fen. At Nordike bridge anciently were four arches: the edge of
    the piers which cut the water was westward; which shows that the water
    originally run eastward, and the whole level was drained that way,
    though now most currents run to Boston. The inhabitants have a constant
    tradition, that this was a great town; but when the haven was filled
    up, Boston became the sea-port: likewise they say there is a road
    across the east fen, called Salter’s road, which probably was the Roman
    road; and there are people now alive who knew such as had remembered
    it. Doubtless this was a place where the Romans made their salt of the
    sea water, to supply all this province; and it is not improbable that
    this road led to Banovallum, Lindum, &amp;c. Many salt hills are visible
    from Wainfleet to Friskney. The king is still lord of the soil of this
    old Roman city.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Burgh</span>, <i>a</i> Ro. <i>fort</i>.</div>

  <p>Three miles north, and as much from Skegness and the sea, is Burgh, a
    market-town, whose name drew my attention. I found it to be a Roman
    <em>castrum</em> to guard the sea-coasts, probably against the Saxon
    rovers: it is a piece of very high ground, partly natural, partly
    raised by Roman labour, overlooking the wide extended marshes, perhaps
    in those times covered with salt water, at least in spring tides. There
    are two artificial <em>tumuli</em>, one very high, called Cock-hill. In
    St. Mary’s church-yard, now demolished, Roman coins have been found. I
    saw a very fair and large Antoninus Pius in brass, cos. <span class="smcap">iiii</span>.
    in possession of Tho. Linny. In the yards and gardens about the town
    they frequently dig up bodies. St. Peter’s church is large and good.
    There appear no Roman ways, <em>vallum</em>, or ditch, to inclose the
    town, which is a sort of knoll, or rising ground.</p>

  <p>I was told of a Roman aqueduct of earth, found at Spilsby. In Halton
    church hard by is this inscription on a flat stone. + <span class="antiqua">SIRE WATER
    BER GIST ICY DE SA ALME DEUS EIT MERCI</span>. Another, a cross-legged
    knight: on his shield a lion rampant. At Hagnaby, a religious house
    founded by Agnes de Orreby. Well, by Ralf de Hauvile. Near Well, on a
    chalky heath, are three curious Celtic barrows contiguous and joined
    one into another, composed of chalk: the chalk in Lincolnshire by
    Alford answers to that in Norfolk. Tateshall collegiate church founded
    by Ralf Cromwell. Many <em>tumuli</em> hereabouts, as at Hagnaby and
    other places, but none so remarkable a curiosity as those by the broad
    road upon the descent of the high country, overlooking the vast level
    towards Boston.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> At Revesby, by the seat of Joseph Banks, esq; there
    is an oval inclosed with a broad ditch: the longest diameter, which
    is somewhat above 300 foot, is precisely east and west; the other a
    little above 100: the entrance to it is on the middle of the south
    side: within, at each end of the length, is a large <em>tumulus</em>
    100 foot in diameter: they are equal in shape and similar positure, a
    large vacuum of 100 foot lying between: it is very regularly formed:
    the length of the oval ditch that incloses the two <em>tumuli</em> is
    equal to thrice the breadth: the <em>tumuli</em> are large and high:
    that rising on the north side, without the ditch, is of an odd figure,
    but similar. It seems to have been a place of sepulture; perhaps two
    British kings were there buried; and the height on the north side
    was the place whereon they sacrificed horses, or the like, to the
    <em>manes</em> of the deceased. Or is it a place of religious worship
    among the old Britons? and the two hills may possibly be the temples
    of the Sun and Moon. I am inclined to think it ancient, because of the
    measure: the breadth is equal to 100 Celtic feet, as I call them; the
    length to 300.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Banovallum.</div>

  <p>Horncastle was undoubtedly the Banovallum in <em>Ravennas</em>:
    the latter part of the word is Latin, so that it signifies the
    fortification upon the river Bane. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXIX.</span>It is of a low situation, placed
    in the angle of the two brooks meeting here, the Bane and Waring;
    whence the modern name Horncastle, which signifies an angle, all this
    country over, as you know in your neighbouring Cow-hurn, Holbech-hurn,
    Guy-hurn, &amp;c. I will not venture to conceit it came from the ancient
    way of painting rivers horned, from their windings and turnings; of
    which we may find a hint in Burton’s Comment. on Antoninus’s Itinerary,
    pag. 56. and they that please may consult Bochart’s <cite>Phaleg</cite>, II.
    22. where are many proofs of the ancients expressing an angle by the
    term <em>horn</em>. Skinner in his <cite>Etymologicon</cite> rightly affirms
    it comes from the Saxon word <em>hyrn</em>; and Ælfricus expounds it by
    the word <em>cornu</em>. It is probable the Romans were induced to make
    a station here at first from its convenient situation, easily rendered
    defensible by a <em>vallum</em> drawn across the aperture from one river
    to the other; and thence came the Roman name. Afterwards they built
    the indissoluble stone wall, whole <em>vestigia</em> are manifest the
    whole compass round, and in some places pretty high, as three or four
    yards, and four yards thick. It serves for sides of gardens, cellars,
    out-houses, &amp;c. as chance offers, inclosing the market-place, church,
    and good part of the town. It is a perfect parallelogram, composed of
    two squares: at the angles have been square towers, as they report:
    the gates were in the middle of three sides, and I suppose a postern
    into the meadows called the Holmes at the union of the two rivulets. I
    suspect originally the river Bane ran nearer to the wall in that part,
    and behind the manor-house: the garden there has been heightened, and
    the river pushed farther off, and turned with a larger bow to favour
    the people who live in Far-street, and especially the tanners, who
    are very numerous there: both rivers probably were wider and deeper
    than now, as the Celtic name of <em>Bane altus</em> intimates, which at
    present is conformable to reality lower down. Some do not scruple to
    affirm it was a sea-port, that is, navigable. The Waring arises but
    a mile or two off. The field across it south of the town is called
    the Thowng and Cagthorp, and probably was its <em>pomæria</em>, from
    the Saxon word <em>pang</em>, <em>campus</em>, <em>ager</em>. Here they
    find a great number of Roman coins. I saw a brass coin of Vespasian;
    reverse, an eagle, <span class="allsmcap">CONSECRATIO</span>; dug up from under the walls
    of Banovallum: Mr. Hograve of the place has it now: but Horncastle was
    not built in the time of Vespasian. I saw, in possession of Mr. Terry
    of Lincoln, a silver Vespasian found here; reverse, a sitting Genius
    with a sympulum in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> hand, and <span class="allsmcap">DN. MA</span>. In 1734, a girl
    digging sand by the road side going from Les Yates to Horncastle, and
    near Horncastle, dug up an earthen urn full of Roman coins, rings, &amp;c.
    Mr. Terry collector gave me some of them. Near the walls upon digging
    cellars they sometimes find bodies buried. A rivulet called Temsford
    runs into the Bane. The school lands were given by private persons,
    and it was incorporated by queen Elizabeth: their seal is a castle and
    hunting-horn: and a horn is the brand for the town cattle upon the
    common. It is dubious whether Bowbridge has its name from the arch of
    the bridge, or from its being the entrance into the town from Lindum
    through the gate called formerly a Bow. This way is the maypole-hill,
    where probably stood an Hermes in Roman times. The boys annually keep
    up the festival of the <em>Floralia</em> on May day, making a procession
    to this hill with <em>May gads</em> (as they call them) in their hands:
    this is a white willow wand, the bark peeled off, tied round with
    cowslips, a <em>thyrsus</em> of the Bacchanals: at night they have a
    bonfire and other merriment; which is really a sacrifice, or religious
    festival. The king formerly had this whole town in his possession,
    until it was bestowed on the bishop of Carlisle. Near the conflux
    of the two brooks was lately a pleasant garden, and a place called
    Julian’s Bower, much talked of.</p>

    Glossary. I guess the first monastery founded here was on the south
    of the present church; for I saw vast stone walls dug up there,
    and a plain leaden cross taken up; in my possession. Many were the
    religious houses here in superstitious times, whose lands were given
    to the corporation by Hen. VIII. as likewise the estate of the lord
    Hussey, beheaded then at Lincoln for rebellion: he lived in one of
    the houses where is a great square tower of brick, called now Hussey
    tower. There are many such in this country, as that now called Rochford
    and sometimes Richmond tower, which is very high. Queen Mary was a
    great benefactress to this corporation, and gave them lands called
    Erection-lands, to pay a vicar, a lecturer, and two school-masters:
    they have now a revenue of a thousand pounds per annum. In the

    a weary traveller with its astonishing aspect even at ten miles

    farther by sea: the lantern at top is very beautiful, and the thinness
    of the stone-work is admirable. There was a prodigious clock-bell,
    which could be heard six or seven miles round, with many old verses
    round it: about the year 1710 they knocked it in pieces, without taking
    the inscription. Twenty yards from the foundation of this tower runs
    the rapid Witham, through a bridge of wood. On the south side of the
    church-yard was, some few years ago, a curious monument<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> (as they
    say) of one of the builders of the church, in stone, of arched work,
    but now intirely demolished; and in the market place in my memory was

    gave to the honourable gentleman of that name. Several frieries here,
    black, white and grey; of which little remains. Oliver Cromwell, then a
    colonel, lay in Boston the night before he fought the battle of Winceby
    near Horncastle, Oct. 5. 1643. In North Holland they have a custom of
    pulling geese twice a year; which has not escaped Pliny’s notice, X.
    22. There is nothing left of the adjacent Swineshed abbey, founded by
    Rob. Greisly, but a yew-tree and a knightly tomb fixed in the wall
    of the new house. Here king John sickened in his journey to Sleeford
    castle and Newark castle, where he died.</p>

  <p>East of Boston was a chapel called Hiptoft, and in the town a church
    dedicated to St. John, but demolished. Here was a staple for wool and
    several other commodities, and a vast foreign trade: the hall was
    pulled down in my time. The great hall of St. Mary’s Guild is now
    the place of meeting for the corporation and sessions, &amp;c. Here was

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Kirton.</div>

  <p>Pass we from Boston by Kirkton, famous for apples, denominated from its
    fair church built by Alexander, that magnificent bishop of Lincoln,
    after the manner of a cathedral with a transept. It has a handsome
    tower standing upon four pillars in the middle of the cross, with a
    noble ring of five large bells. I observe, this building is set upon
    the ruins of a former <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>church, part whereof is visible at the
    west end: and in most of the churches in this country the same may be
    discovered, from the different manner of the architecture; the most
    ancient having small windows arched semicircularly; what is additional,
    to be known by the pointed Gothic arches. This church is very neat both
    within and without: upon the font is this inscription:</p>

  <div class="center">+ <span class="antiqua" lang="la">Orate pro anima alani burton qui fontem istum fieri fec. a. d.

  <p class="noindent">Against the north wall is the monument of a person in armour, and round
    it this inscription,</p>

  <div class="center">+ <span class="antiqua" lang="la">Orate pro anima Iohannis de Meres.</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">The family of the Meres has flourished much hereabouts.</p>

  <p class="clear">Upon the edge of Lincolnshire, in the middle of a vast fenny level,
    <span class="sidenote smcap">Crowland.</span>Crowland is situate, memorable for its early religion and the ruins
    of an opulent monastery, which still makes a considerable prospect.
    The abbey presents a majestic view of ruins; founded a thousand years
    ago, by Athelbald king of the Mercians, in a horrid silence of bogs
    and thorns;<span class="sidenote">TAB. IV.</span> made eminent for the holy retirement of his chaplain
    Guthlac, who changed the gaieties of the court for the severities of
    an anchorite. The king endowed it with a profuse hand, and all the
    land for several miles round the church belonged to it. The foundation
    is laid on piles of wood drove into the ground with gravel and sand,
    and they have found several of them in tearing up the ruins of the
    eastern part of the church; for what remains now is only part of the
    west end; and of that only one corner in tolerable repair, which is
    their parish-church at present. It is not difficult at this time to
    distinguish part of the very first building of this church, from that
    which was built by Ingulphus.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In the middle of the cross stood once
    a lofty tower and a remarkably fine ring of bells, of which there is a
    proverb in this country still remaining: one prodigiously great bell
    was sacred to Guthlac: they are said to have been the first peal of
    bells in the county, perhaps England.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> From the foundation of this
    tower to the west end, is somewhat left, but only the walls, pillars,
    with passages or galleries at top, and stair-cases at the corners. The
    roof, which was of Irish oak finely carved and gilt, fell down about
    twenty years ago: you see pieces of it in every house. The pavement is
    covered with shrubs for brass inscriptions, and people now at pleasure
    dig up the monumental stones, and divide the holy shipwreck for their
    private uses; so that, instead of one, most of the houses in the town
    are become religious. The painted glass was broke by the soldiers in
    the rebellion, for they made a garrison of the place. All the eastern
    part of the body of the church is intirely razed to the foundation;
    and the ashes as well as tombs of an infinite number of illustrious
    personages, kings, abbots, lords, knights, &amp;c. there hoping for repose,
    are dispersed, to the irreparable damage of English history. The great
    Waltheof, earl of Northumberland and Huntingdon, was one of the saints
    here: he was beheaded by the Norman conqueror. The monastic buildings,
    cloysters, hall, abbot’s lodgings,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and the like, which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>no doubt
    were very fine, are absolutely demolished; no trace thereof left,
    whereby their extent might be guessed at. In the north-west corner
    of the church stands a strong tower with a very obtuse spire, and a
    pleasant ring of small bells. Over the west gate are the images of
    divers kings, abbots, &amp;c. among the rest St. Guthlac with a whip and
    knife, as always painted: they were cut in a soft kind of stone, and
    drawn over in oil colour with gilding.</p>

  <p>Not far off the abbey eastward, upon a hillock, is the remnant of a
    little stone cottage, called Anchor Church-house: here was a chapel
    over the place where St. Guthlac lived a hermit, and where he was
    buried.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Over-against the
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. VII.</span>west end of the abbey is the famous
    triangular bridge: it is too steep to be commonly rode over; horses and
    carriages go under it: it is formed upon three segments of a circle
    meeting in one point; they say each base stands in a different county.
    The rivers Nyne and Welland here meet. On one side sits an image of
    king Athelbald with a globe in his hand. St. Guthlake’s cross, between
    Spalding and Crowland, near Brother-house and Cloot-bar, stands upon
    the side of the bank, almost buried under earth: it is a boundary of
    the church lands: <span class="sidenote">TAB. XI.</span>of great antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

  <p>The many hours I have spent with you when I first began to cast my eyes
    upon the scenes of the world, and consider things about me, recur to my
    mind with pleasure. I should be ungrateful then, (to which my temper
    is most abhorrent) and I should deny myself a particular satisfaction,
    did I not acknowledge the remembrance of a friendship now mature:
    therefore to you I offer the earliest fruits of it, this small account
    of the first pleasurable journey I can reckon to myself, where I had
    opportunity for satisfying my growing curiosity. It is no wonder that
    your learning, your taste of antiquities, and all endearing qualities,
    made me fond of cultivating your acquaintance; and perhaps to you in
    great measure do I owe what may not be discommendable in amusements of
    the following kind, since <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>our converse and our journeying sometimes
    together, to visit the remains of venerable antiquity, in my first
    years, gave me the love and incitement to such pursuits. I am not
    concerned to make an excuse for the meanness of this present: were
    it not juvenile, it would not be genuine. As when first with you, so
    since it has been my method, to put into writing what little remarks I
    made in travelling: at length I had collected so much, that with some
    drawings of places and things taken at the same time, it was judged not
    unworthy of publication: my consent was grounded upon hopes that by
    this means I might give some account of every part of my time, and that
    my own pleasures might not be altogether unuseful; especially thinking
    it was no hard task to equal somewhat of this sort lately done, and
    well received of the public. It is to be wished this branch of learning
    should revive among us, which has lain dormant since the great Camden;
    so that either in discoursing on it, or journeying, we might find some
    entertainment worthy of men of letters.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Stanford.</div>

  <p>Passing the fenny counterscarps of Holland, we begin our journey at
    Stanford, which stands in a mild air and pleasant country abounding
    with noblemen’s seats. Many religious houses have been at Stanford,
    and once a college founded there, of which they boast much; but of
    all these things we expect shortly an exact and full account from the
    reverend Mr. Peck. About 1708, a brass seal was dug up, in the castle
    at Stanford, of Thomas bishop of Elphin in Ireland; in possession
    of Ralf Madyson, esq. Burghley, the earl of Exeter’s, is worth a
    traveller’s view: the rooms are finely painted by Seignior Varrio:
    abundance of curious pictures from Italy, collected by my lord’s
    grandfather. At St. Martin’s church are the monuments of that noble
    family.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Foderinghay.</div>

  <p>Through a pleasant and woody country, we went to Foderinghay castle,
    situate on a branch of the river Nyne, overlooking the adjacent country
    and wide-extended meadows. The castle seems to have been very strong:
    there was a high mount, or keep, environed with a deep ditch: the
    space around it is guarded by a wall, double ditch, and the river: it
    is mostly demolished, and all the materials carried off. They pretend
    to show the ruins of the hall where Mary queen of Scots was beheaded.
    Some say king James I. ordered this fortress to be destroyed out of
    indignation: it was the seat of Edmund of Langley, duke of York,
    buried in the collegiate church here, a very neat building, founded by
    Edward duke of York, and here likewise interred: their monuments in
    the chancel (which was intirely demolished at the suppression) were
    restored by queen Elizabeth: the windows of the church are filled with
    very handsome painted glass, representing the images of cardinals,
    arch-bishops, abbots, &amp;c. such as St. Denis with his head in his hand,
    St. Guthlac of Croyland, Richard Scrope arch-bishop of Canterbury, &amp;c.
    these were saved in the late civil war, by the then minister of the
    parish, with a little money given to the soldiers that came to execute
    the harmless saints. We met with these uncouth verses upon the wall,
    showing the poetry of those times:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza" lang="la">
        <div class="i0"><i>In festo Martyrii processus Martiniani,</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>Ecclesiæ prima fuit hujus petra locata,</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>Anno Christi primum centum ac mille</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>Cum deca quinta H. V. tunc imminente 2<sup>da.</sup></i></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">On the north side of the church are the remains of the college, and the
    meadow under it retains its name: the steeple has an octagonal tower
    at the top, somewhat like that of Boston; at the bases of which are
    the images<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> of bears and ragged staffs, cognisances (I suppose) of the
    founders; as the falcon and fetterlock often painted in the glass. They
    have a very ancient MS. book here, of the affairs of the parish. There
    is a school in the town, erected by Hen. VII. worth about 30l. per
    ann. over the door is wrote, <i lang="la">Disce aut discede</i>. A stone bridge
    over the river was built by queen Elizabeth anno 1555. shown by an
    inscription on the wall, a monument of the spite of the soldiers, who
    cut out with their swords, as they passed by, one line of it, <em>God
    save the queen</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Oundale.</div>

  <p>Oundale, or Avondale, is remarkable for a drumming well, much talked
    of by the superstitious vulgar: no doubt it is owing to the passage of
    the water, and air upon certain conditions, through the subterraneous
    chinks; for, as Virgil says, in his fine poem called <cite>Ætna</cite>,</p>

  <div class="center-container">

  <p class="noindent">and that it is done by intervals or pulses as it were, is but
    consentaneous to many of Nature’s operations. Here are two long
    bridges of stone. Louick church, on the side of a hill, is very fine,
    founded by John de Drayton, anno 1125: the windows are full of coats
    of arms. There is a picture of the founder in armour, on his knees,
    presenting his church to God: here is his monument, of the Veres too,
    and Staffords earls of Wiltshire, and others who intermarried with his
    family: there is a modern one of the late Dutchess of Norfolk, who was
    married, after her divorcement, to the present owner of the family
    seat, called Drayton house, Sir John Germayn, who has for the most part
    new-built it.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Boughton.</div>

  <p>From hence we went to Boughton, the seat of the duke of Montagu,
    magnificent for building, painting and gardens: the stables are large
    and stately, well calculated for the designed grandeur of the house;
    for it is not yet finished: the hall is a very noble room: on the
    cieling is a convocation of the gods admirably painted, as are many
    suites of rooms and apartments, stair-cases, galleries, &amp;c. beside
    the great numbers of portraits and other curious pictures, part of
    the furniture: the gardens contain fourscore and ten acres of ground,
    adorned with statues, flower-pots, urns of marble and metal, many very
    large basons, with variety of fountains playing, aviaries, reservoirs,
    fish-ponds, canals, admirable greens, wildernesses, terraces, &amp;c. the
    cascade is very fine: a whole river, running through the length of the
    gardens, is diversified very agreeably to complete its beauty.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Geddington.</div>

  <p>A mile off is Geddington, where in a <em>trivium</em> stands one of
    the stone crosses<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> built by king Edward I. in memory of his queen
    Eleanor, who died at Hareby near Bolingbroke, in Lincolnshire, 1291.
    It is formed upon a triangular model, of pretty Gothic architecture
    to suit its station. Her bowels were buried by the high altar in
    the Lady’s chapel of Lincoln minster; and in her journey thence to
    Westminster, where ever her herse rested, the king erected one of these
    magnificent crosses, as a monument of his great love: upon them are
    the arms of England, Castile, Leon and Poictou. These are the places,
    as far as I am at present informed, Lincoln, Grantham, Stamford,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
    Geddington, Northampton, Stony Stratford, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>Dunstable, St. Alban’s,
    Waltham, Cheapside over against Wood-street, Charing-cross. Near this
    place is Boughton, having a petrifying spring, which forms itself a
    canal of stone as it runs, consolidating the twigs, moss, and all
    adventitious bodies. We saw near the road a spring-head, with a statue
    of Moses in the middle of the water, belonging to Boughton house.</p>

  <p class="clear"><span class="sidenote smcap">Eltabona.</span>Through Kettering we went to Northampton, the most elegant town
    in England: which, being wholly burnt down, is rebuilt with great
    regularity and beauty. There is a spacious square market-place, a fine
    assize-house of Corinthian architecture. Allhallow’s church is built
    after a pretty model, with a cupola and a noble portico before it of
    eight lofty Ionic columns: upon the balustrade a statue of king Charles
    II. There is an inscription of John Bailes, aged above 126: his sight,
    hearing and memory, intire; buried 1706. One of the old churches, St.
    Sepulchre’s, seems to have belonged to the Knights Hospitalers of St.
    John of Jerusalem, of a circular form: there has been another tacked to
    it of later date, with a choir and steeple, as to that at Cambridge of
    the same name and figure: another such I am told is at Guildford, which
    are all of this sort that I know of in England. I suspect these are
    the most ancient churches in England, and probably built in the later
    times of the Romans for Christian service, at least in the early Saxon
    reigns. Westward are the ruins of the castle, by the river side, built
    by Simon Silvanect I. earl of Northampton, who founded here likewise
    St. Andrew’s abbey: his son Simon Silvanect II. earl of Northampton
    and Huntingdon, founded St. Mary de Près abbey here about 1150. This
    probably is a Roman town arising from one of the forts built upon this
    river, as that great people proceeded northward in the conquest of the
    island; and being mentioned by Ravennas between Leicester and Stoney
    Stratford, it is very likely the Eltabona there, meaning <em>ael</em>,
    <em>supercilium</em>, and Avon, the river. Roman coins have been found
    on the other side the river: there are likewise the footsteps of the
    fortifications round the town, thrown up with bastions in the time of
    the civil wars. Under those on the south side, descending into a stone
    quarry which has abundance of intricate turnings, I saw a piece of oak
    wood, as big as both one’s hands, lie between the <em>strata</em> of
    solid stone: though petrified, the ligneous fibres when split would
    burn in a candle. I suppose it to have been lodged there in the deluge.
    A little way from the town, about Sprotton, are the pits where they dig
    up tobacco-pipe clay. Near Billing, about three miles from Northampton,
    not far from the earl of Twomond’s seat, was lately found a mine of
    copper, and coal, and marble, as they told me.</p>

  <p>From Northampton, over the river, by a large stone bridge where is an
    old religious house, half a mile off in the London road, is another of
    queen Eleanor’s stone crosses, called Queen’s cross, with her images
    and arms. It stands on a hill in the open country upon eight steps, in
    form much like that of Waltham, of which I have given a print.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XII.</span> On the
    other side of the town, about three miles distance, is Holdenby house,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>which lies in noble ruins: here king Charles I. was kept prisoner.
    A little way off is Naseby,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> where the bloody and fatal battle
    happened between his forces and those of the parliament, upon a fine
    plain where at present stands a windmill: the marks of several great
    holes appear, where the slain were buried. This town, as near as may
    be, is the navel of England. Near is<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Guildsborough.</span> Roman <i>Camp</i>.</span>
    Guildsborough, so named from a
    Roman camp of a square form, and deep ditch, called the Burrows. I
    was told of several more thereabouts, which I suppose those made in
    the time of Ostorius about the heads of the rivers here; which all
    together made a sort of fortification between the north and south parts
    of the kingdom, especially between the Avon and Severn. A long barrow
    at Pesford, called Longman’s hill. We saw Althorp, a curious seat of
    the earl of Sunderland’s, elegantly furnished: there is a fine gallery
    adorned with good pictures, and a noble library.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Eston.</div>

  <p>My lord Lemster’s seat, now earl of Pomfret, near Towcester, is
    a stately building, and stands pleasantly, encompassed with good
    plantations of wood, visto’s and agreeable prospects. In the grand view
    to the back front, beyond the garden, is a large and long canal: in the
    house are several curious pictures; an original, of Sir Paul Ricot; of
    a pillar of Persepolis, one of those sixty foot high; Perseus loosing
    Andromeda, by Gioseppi Cari; a copy of Galatea, from Raphael: but what
    highly inhances the glory of this seat, is the vast number of Roman
    and Greek marbles, statues, busto’s, bas reliefs, &amp;c. part of the most
    noble collection of the great earl of Arundel. My lord has it in his
    thoughts to build a large room, or gallery, to receive this invaluable
    treasure; at present they are for the most part exposed to the weather
    in the garden. I shall cursorily name them all with the haste of a
    traveller, though each single piece merits a serious view, and a long
    description.</p>

  <p>At the end of the side terrace in the garden, and near the house,
    stands an intire column of marble in two pieces, fluted, taken from
    among the ruins of the temple of Apollo at the isle of Delos, where
    many now lie: this is set upon a proper base and pedestal made
    purposely for it: the capital is unusual, but very beautiful, and
    seems perfectly to answer that description which Vitruvius gives
    us, IV. 1. of the origin of the Corinthian capital from the conceit
    of Callimachus, who was pleased with the appearance of a basket
    covered with a tile, and luckily set upon the middle of a root of
    <em>acanthus</em>, or <em>brank ursin</em>, which shot up its curled leaves
    around it in a delicate and tender manner: upon it stands a statue,
    the upper part naked. In the niches of that wall along the walk are
    several broken statues of goddesses, naked or in fine drapery, where
    the mind is divided between the pleasure of seeing what remains and
    the grief for what is lost. Upon the stairs that descend into the
    garden are a great many whole and broken statues, pieces of <em>basso
    relievo</em>, altars, urns, tombs, &amp;c. such as the destruction of Troy,
    represented in the Trojan horse, the merriment of the Trojans, the
    slaughter of Priamus, Achilles driving his chariot with Hector tied
    to it: there is another bas-relief of a battle; a figure recumbent at
    dinner; two figures in procession, but covered over with moss; four
    figures, two with Phrygian bonnets; good pieces of cornice-work, with
    mouldings of ovolo’s, bead-moulds, &amp;c. a tomb, the husband and wife
    with the son between; a piece of Bacchanalians; the end of a tomb, or
    vase; a mask and revelling figures; an horseman and footman engaging.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>Most of these antiquities seem of the highest Greek times. Before the
    steps upon pedestals are two Egyptian <em>sphynges</em> mitred, and two
    Muses sitting: other things thereabouts are a sea-horse in basso; a man
    carrying another; a capital of a pillar made of a horse’s head, with
    branches coming out of his mouth like them at Persepolis, a dog’s head
    on one angle, and lions on the other: upon it are busts and heads: over
    that is a portal of a monumental stone, with a woman and two children,
    the tomb of some player, with fine bassos of masks, the busto of the
    deceased; four Genii; two lions devouring horses, finely cut: over it
    a priestess by the side of a temple: eight round altars or pedestals
    adorned with bulls heads, festoons, &amp;c. which stand upon the piers of
    the stairs: upon and about them are other antiquities, such as the
    bottom part of Scylla; three monsters like dogs devouring three men; a
    receiver for an urn. Cupid asleep lies upon this.</p>

  <p>On the north side the front of the house, a tomb; another capital of
    a horse’s head, &amp;c. over it a basso of Venus riding on a sea-horse, a
    Cupid driving; a lion over it; two Cupids, <em>alto relievo</em>: some
    busts over the windows; a young Nero, Faunus, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>At the south end of the house, on the ground, an old headless statue;
    upon the basement, a tomb of a boy wrought in channel-work, his busto
    in basso upon it: over the windows a small statue; a woman with a child
    in her arms; a tomb; another capital from the temple of Apollo at
    Delos; a Greek mask.</p>

  <p>Next let us descend into the garden along the middle walk. In the
    parterres about the fountain stand four Greek statues very intire,
    bigger than the life, of most admirable art: they are dressed in
    matron-like robes, or outer garments, in most comely folds, yet cut
    so exquisitely, that the folds of the inner drapery appear, and the
    whole shape of the body, as if transparent: they cannot be sufficiently
    commended. Between them and the house on the south side, is that
    celebrated statue of Cicero intire, with his <em>sudarium</em> in his
    right, and a scroll in his left hand: the sight of the eyes is cut
    hollow. I could not possibly excuse my self half a quarter of an hour’s
    serious view of this master-piece, frequently going round it: where so
    much seeming simplicity of the carver, has called forth all the fire
    of that divine genius that could make statues hear, as this artist has
    made them speak, and left an eternal monument of contention between
    him and the great orator: it grieved me to think it should stand a
    day longer in the open air. Answering to this on the left, is another
    statue of more robust shape and workmanship: his left hand holds a
    scroll, his right is laid in a passionate manner upon his breast: if
    sinewy muscles denote one that worked on the anvil, it may possibly
    be Demosthenes. The two next that correspond beyond the fountain, are
    Scipio Africanus and Asiaticus, in an heroic dress. Beyond, on each
    side the steps going down to the lower garden, are two <em>colossi</em>,
    Fabius Maximus the cunctator, and Archimides with a square in his
    hand. At each end of this cross-walk, or terrace, which terminates the
    middle or principal one, is built a handsome stone-work with niches
    and pediment supported with pilasters, contrived on purpose to receive
    other pieces: in that on the left hand, or north side, is the tomb
    of the famous Germanicus, adorned with carving of bas-relief: upon
    it two admirable busts of him and Agrippina his wife. Between these
    upon the tomb stands an altar-like pedestal with a small and ancient
    statue of Jupiter sitting. In the pediment over the arch is a curious
    piece of marble, whereon is raised the upper part of a man with his
    arms and hands extended, and the impression likewise of a foot: this
    I suppose the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> original standard of the Greek measure. Upon the
    <em>apex</em> of the pediment is a fine statue of Apollo with the right
    arm naked, the other covered with a mantle: below the hips it ends in
    a <em>terminus</em>; so that it is an <em>Hermapollon</em>. In two niches
    here, are two large and curious trunks, as fine as the loquacious
    Pasquin or Marforio at Rome. Upon the two outermost pilasters are
    two other beautiful trunks. At the corner of this terrace is an
    altar. At the other end of this cross walk, under the stone-work is a
    marble chair with an inscription on the back of it, denoting that it
    belonged to the high-priest of Isis, as said; for it is obliterated:
    it is remarkably easy to sit on: the sides are embossed with winged
    <em>sphynges</em>. On each side of it are two sitting fragments. Upon
    the top of this stone-work is a very large and curious Greek statue of
    Pallas, coloss proportion, naked arms, a plumed helmet on her head, the
    Gorgonian <em>Ægis</em> on her breast: the very marble is not without its
    terror.</p>

  <p>We shall now pass through the house. The hall is a fine lofty room:
    in the niches are several statues; a Greek lady with her arms folded
    under the drapery, which with that of the under garment are perfectly
    seen through the robe; Caius Marius in a senatorial habit; Cupid
    asleep, leaning on his torch: M. Antony, a naked figure; all these as
    big as the life: over the chimney-piece, a little Hercules tearing
    the lion; seven bustos, an excellent one of Pindar; one said to be
    of Olympias, I fancied it Lucretia. By the great stairs, painted in
    <em>fresco</em> by Sir James Thornhill, two bustos, one of the Grecian
    Venus. In niches upon the stairs, six statues as big as the life: Diana
    in a hunting-habit, a tuck’d-up coat, buskins of skins; a lady in
    Greek drapery; the Venus de Medicis; Paris with a mantle, the Phrygian
    bonnet, and odd stockings of the Dacian mode; (this is a statue of
    great antiquity;) a nymph with a long flowing garment tied under the
    breast, a fine turn of the body; a man, the right shoulder naked. In
    the little dining-room, over the chimney, an antique marble vase. In
    the green-house I saw these following: a Flora, the upper part lost;
    most inimitable drapery to show the naked, like the celebrated one at
    Rome: a coloss head of Apollo, from the collar bone to the crown of the
    head three foot; the body is said to lie among many more under Arundel
    house in London: the trunk of Camilla, both arms: a young Bacchus.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Towcester</span> Roman.</div>

  <p>Towcester is a pretty town, of Roman antiquity: through it in a strait
    line runs the Watling-street. Edward the elder built the mount called
    Berry hill when he fortified the town against the Danes. Roman coins
    have been oft found at this place.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The inhabitants here, both old
    and young, are very busy in a silken manufacture, and making of lace.
    This town has been ditched about on the west side; every where else
    guarded by the rivers.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Buckingham.</div>

  <p>From hence we went through spacious woods to Buckingham. There was a
    castle before the Conquest, but now scarce to be known. The church is
    well built, particularly the chancel: they showed us a place called St.
    Rumbald’s shrine, where his coffin was taken up. St. John Baptist’s
    chapel, built, as said, by archbishop Becket, is now a free school.
    From this place we travelled upon a Roman road.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Alauna.</div>

  <p>Entering Oxfordshire, we saw on our right the park called Caversfield,
    which antiquaries say was the place where Allectus slew Carausius.
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. V. VI. 2d Vol.</span>This is near Bicester, which I visited big with expectation of finding
    somewhat considerable from a conflux of towns’ names that promised
    much. I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>observed Lawnton hard by, which seemed to confirm Mr.
    Baxter’s conjecture of Alauna hereabouts. Chesterton, Aldchester, and
    Wandlebury, were specious marks for enquiry; but I find they all depend
    upon Aldchester, where was the undoubted Alauna of Ravennas, mentioned
    thus in that valuable author. Next to London, Tamese, Branavis, Alauna;
    of all which I shall give an account in this journey.</p>

  <p class="clear"><span class="sidenote smcap">Akeman-street.</span>South of Bicester about a mile, two Roman roads cross one another
    at right angles, in the middle of a large and beautiful meadow; the
    Akeman-street running east and west, and another directly north and
    south: the first comes out of Buckinghamshire, I imagine from Fenny
    Stratford through Winslow; passes by here at Longford, over Bicester
    river, under the north side of Gravenhall hill; so proceeds by
    Aldchester, Kirklington, to Woodstock park, and so to Cirencester: the
    other crosses it at Aldchester, running directly through the middle of
    the city; then through the southern meadow belonging to Wandlebury,
    where it is visible enough to a nice eye, the grass being poor, and
    much abates of the verdure for its whole breadth: then entering a
    pasture, it is very plain, being elevated into a ridge of a hundred
    foot breadth, and two little ditches all along the sides: it leaves
    Marton on the east and Fencot, making fords over the brooks, paved
    with great broad stones its whole breadth; then proceeds the length
    of Ottmore, a spacious level, marsh or meadow, two or three miles
    together, where its ridge is plain, though broken by many sloughs; then
    through Beckly by the park wall; then under Shotover hill, and so, I
    suppose, passes the Thames at Sandford below Oxford. Northward from
    Alauna it proceeds through the northern meadow belonging to Chesterton
    and Bicester, where the stones it is composed of may be seen in the
    little ditches they have dug upon each side; then it enters the lane,
    and goes on the west side of Bicester town, at some little distance,
    and strait forwards on the east of Caverfield park by Stretton Audley,
    where many Roman coins have been found; and so to Radley by Buckingham,
    being now the great high road between the two towns, of which we may
    say, in the poet’s words,</p>

  <p>The city called now Aldchester is a parcel of ploughed field, on the
    south side of the Akeman way, a mile at least south of Bicester:
    it stands in the middle of the meadow, which is very level, more
    especially stretching itself north and south of the city. I know not
    whether the ground which is the site of the city be naturally higher,
    or raised by the ruins and rubbish thereof: but, if any, this deserves
    to be called <em>urbs pratensis</em>. I can scarce believe that this
    meadow was so subject to inundations as now, at the time of setting
    the city here; and I never observed the like position elsewhere,
    when there is higher ground near enough: it may be thought rather a
    city of pleasure than strength. A very little way off to the east
    is Gravenhall hill, a copped hill curiously covered with wood and
    hedge-rows: beyond it is Berry hill, or vulgarly the Brill, guarded
    at top with one of their camps. A little brook comes from Chesterton,
    a mile off, and runs on the south side of the city; for between that
    and the Akeman way is it placed. When I came upon the spot, I soon
    found it by the prodigious blackness and richness of the earth, as
    they were ploughing; and this shows it to have been once in a very
    flourishing condition and populous; for the fund of nitrous particles
    and animal salts lodged in this earth are inexhaustible. The site of
    this city is a common, belonging to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> the inhabitants of Wandlebury,
    and every one has a certain little portion of it to plough up; whence
    we may well imagine the land is racked to the last extremity, and
    no great care taken in the management of it: yet it bears very good
    crops of wheat. As I traversed the spot, at every step I saw pieces
    of pots and vessels, of all sorts of coloured earth,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> red, green,
    and some perfectly of blue clay, that came from Aynhoe: I picked up
    several parcels, thinking to have carried them away, till I perceived
    them strown very thick over the whole field, together with bits of
    bricks of all sorts: the husbandmen told me they frequently break their
    ploughs against foundations of hewn stone and brick; and we saw upon
    the spot many paving stones with a smooth face, and laid in a very good
    bed of gravel, till they draw them all up by degrees, when the plough
    chances to go a little deeper than ordinary. Infinite numbers of coins
    have been found, and dispersed over the adjacent villages without any
    regard; and after a shower of rain now, they say, sometimes they find
    them: I got two or three of Tetricus jun. &amp;c. A good while ago, they
    dug up a glass urn full of ashes, laid in a cavity cut out of a stone:
    I went to see the stone, used as a pig-trough, at Wandlebury, in which
    office it has served ever since Dr. Plot’s time; for I find he mentions
    it, page 329: it is squarish, the cavity is roundish, nine inches deep,
    and a foot diameter; but the urn was broke and lost. I heard likewise,
    by enquiry, that they have found brass images, <em>lares</em>, and all
    sorts of antiquities, which I encouraged them to preserve for the
    future. This city was fenced with a bank and ditch quite round: it is a
    square of one thousand foot each side, standing upon the four cardinal
    points: the <em>vallum</em> and ditch are sufficiently visible, though
    both have met with equal change; the <em>vallum</em>, from the plough,
    which levels it to a certain quantity every year; and the inundation of
    the meadow raises the ditch: these are most easily discernible at the
    corners, for there they are still pretty perfect, and so notoriously,
    that the country people tell you in those places were four towers to
    defend the city. This little brook, that runs on the southern ditch,
    encompassed the city quite round originally: the track of the way that
    passes the city in the middle from south to north, is still very high
    raised, and another street crossed it the contrary way in the middle,
    and so went eastward, meeting the Akeman in its way to Langford: these
    were the two principal streets, and doubtless there were others; and
    great foundations are known to be all around in the meadows, especially
    northward and eastward upon both sides the Akeman. On the west side
    of the city, a little distance from the ditch, is an artificial hill
    in the very middle of the meadow which they call the Castle hill,
    and is full of Roman bricks, stone, and foundations. I attentively
    considered this place: the circuit of it is very plain and definable;
    it was a square of two hundred foot: I guess it originally to have been
    some considerable building in the middle of an <em>area</em>, or court;
    whether a <em>pretorium</em>, or a temple, might probably be ascertained
    upon digging: the edge of the <em>area</em> is very distinct upon the
    meadow, by the difference in the colour of the grass, the one gray,
    the other green; but the main body of the building reached not so
    far, but lies in a great heap of rubbish, much elevated, and of much
    less extent: before it, to the south, has been another <em>area</em>,
    paved with a bed of gravel, at least above a hundred foot broad: I
    doubt not but a curious person, that will be at the expence of digging
    this plot, would find <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>it well worth his while. This is the sum of
    what I observed at the place: whether the present name be Alcester,
    as retaining any thing of the Latin, or Aldcester, signifying the old
    city, I dispute not; but think it has no manner of relation to Allectus
    that slew the brave Carausius. The name of Akeman way I am fit to think
    a vulgar error, as commonly imagined from going to the Bath:<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> more
    probably it is <em>ag maen</em>, the stony <em>agger</em>, or ridge; this
    is confirmed by the people calling the other road too, that goes north
    and south, by the same name, Akeman-street. There has been a religious
    house at Bicester near the church, a priory of St. Eadburg, founded by
    Gilbert Basset. This town is famous for excellent malt liquor, of a
    delicate taste and colour.</p>

  <p>From hence we journeyed by Aynhoe, where is a vein of stiff clay,
    exceeding blue: at Souldern is a curious barrow, neatly turned like a
    bell, small and high; I believe it Celtic. Then climbing for a long
    while together, we ascended <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Bury-hill</span> Ro. <em>camp</em>.</span>Bury hill, a village upon the highest
    copped mountain in the country: it is vulgarly called the Brill, as Mr.
    Camden takes notice: this has a vast prospect over Bernwood, Ottmore,
    and the whole country, bounded only by the superior Chiltern, seven
    miles off, which hence has a most notable aspect, and ends insensibly
    at the eastern and western horizon, diminishing regularly all the way:
    at the top of the Brill, by the church, I saw parcels of the old Roman
    camp, which has been modernised with additional bastions in the civil
    wars. Before the Conquest, here was a palace of Edward the Confessor.
    Much Roman coin has been found hereabout.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Tamese.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. VII. 2d Vol.</div>

  <p>Below here, two or three miles off, stands Tamese, now Tame, upon the
    side of a meadow; a pleasant town, consisting of one long and broad
    street, running north-east and south-west: behind lie the smiling
    arable fields: it is almost encompassed with rivulets. This was called
    a <em>burg</em> in the time of Edward the elder, anno 921, who besieged
    the Danes here, and took the burg, or castle. I saw infinite quantities
    of the <em>cornu ammonis</em>, a foot and half or two foot diameter,
    laid in the roads among rubble stone to mend them: all the quarries
    hereabouts abound with them of all dimensions. Here is a fine large
    church in form of a cross: in it many brasses and old monuments: some I
    transcribed.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Islip.</div>

  <p>Islip is memorable for the birth of Edward the Confessor. The font
    which stood in the king’s chapel, as still called, where he was
    baptised, is removed: but that font in Dr. Plot seems not of such
    antiquity. There are some remains of an ancient palace.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Oxford.</div>

  <p>Oxford requires a more elaborate description than a stranger can
    possibly give; and indeed so numerous are the colleges and halls, that
    one can scarce get a tolerable idea of them in the three days I staid
    here. The prospect of this place from Shotover hill is very inviting,
    nor is our expectation frustrated when in the place. The bridge over
    the Cherwel is a stately work, twice as broad as London bridge.
    Magdalen college, the legacy of our countryman, William of Wainflet,
    which he endowed with a princely hand, deservedly is thought one of the
    noblest foundations in Europe: the old oak is still left, nigh which
    he ordered it to be built. A vast tract of ground is inclosed with a
    castellated wall for gardens. On the other side the river is a park
    too, with long shady walks, but too near the water, wherein likewise
    more resembling those of Academus by Athens. The chapel is large and
    magnificent: the tower is a lofty strong work, in it a fine ring of
    bells: the whimsical figures in the quadrangle, over the buttresses,
    amuse the vulgar; they are the licentious inventions of the mason.
    Over-against this is the physic garden, whose curiosities Mr. Bobart
    showed us, and his own: since his death, its purpose is not so well
    executed. Here are remarkably fine greens in all the gardens at Oxford,
    especially in yew: the two piers here, with flower-pots on them, are
    thought to exceed; but the two yew men (as one waggishly called them)
    that guard the door, are ridiculous; the architecture of these gates
    is, I suppose, of Inigo Jones: two <em>sphynges</em> at the entrance
    are properly placed: these are without the city walls. University
    college has a new quadrangle built by legacy of Dr. Radcliffe; but I
    think uniformity, in this and other structures in the university, no
    sufficient reason for using the old manner of building. Queen’s college
    over-against it is of a good taste, improved to its present splendor
    under the auspices, and in great degree at the charge, of the late Dr.
    Lancaster. The library, the hall, and chapel, are beautiful. The old
    gatehouse has a pretty cieling over it of stone; they say it was the
    chamber of Harry the Vth’s uncle and tutor. Behind it is New college; a
    large chapel, a good visto to the garden, in which is a pleasant mount:
    this was the foundation of William of Wickham, bishop of Winchester:
    it stands in an angle of the old city walls. At All Souls a new court
    is building, but in the anachronism of the Gothic degenerate taste:
    the new library is a spacious room, the legacy of colonel Coddrington:
    the chapel is very elegant; the altar, entirely of marble, was made at
    the charge of George Clark, esq. one of the fellows. Christ church,
    the magnificent work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> cardinal Wolsey: the stone cieling over the
    entrance to the hall is very pretty; the new quadrangle, designed by
    the learned Dr. Aldrich, is beautiful. St. John’s college has two
    handsome quadrangles, the portico’s built by archbishop Laud: two
    fine statues, in brass, of king Charles I. and his queen, probably
    designed by Inigo Jones. But it is impossible for me to run through
    the whole of this splendid university, which I leave as a fitter task
    for some of her own learned sons. The school is a large building: the
    Bodleian library, an immense store-house of most valuable books and
    manuscripts, the donation of archbishop Laud, the earl of Pembroke, O.
    Cromwell, Selden, Digby, Bodley, and other great names: over it is a
    spacious gallery, adorned with pictures of founders, benefactors, and
    others, and with the antique marbles which were the learned part of
    the inexhaustible collection of the earl of Arundel: these have been
    illustrated with the accurate comments of Selden and Prideaux. Here
    are some of the most valuable Greek monuments now in the world. Over
    the porch, upon a handsome pedestal of black marble, stands the brass
    effigies of the earl of Pembroke, their noble and generous chancellor,
    given by the present earl: this was moulded by Rubens. Here is likewise
    a very large collection of Greek, Roman, British, Saxon, English, and
    other coins, presented by several hands. The divinity schools, finished
    by Humphry the good duke of Gloucester, have a very curious stone
    roof. The Ashmolean repository, beside some good books, papers and
    MSS. of the founder, has a large collection of rarities in antiquity,
    nature and art, &amp;c. such as original pictures of famous men, marbles
    of old Egyptian carving in figures and hieroglyphics, a fine marble
    inscription in Arabic, which was over the door of a school at Tangier;
    an Egyptian mummy, being a man dressed like <em>orus Apollo</em>; the
    cradle of Henry VI. the hat of Bradshaw plaited with steel within,
    under which he sat in judgment upon king Charles I. a vast fund of
    precious and other stones, &amp;c. which it is impossible to enumerate.
    Here is, beside, a choice apparatus of instruments for chymistry and
    experimental philosophy under the direction of Mr. Whiteside. The
    printing-house is a good building with a bold portico, but next the
    schools disgraced with a wretched statue of my lord Clarendon. Between
    these two last and the schools stands the Sheldonian theatre, the
    first piece of architecture of Sir Christopher Wren, a spacious and
    well-proportioned room: it is worth while to go upon the top of it,
    to see the carpentry of the roof, and the fine prospect of the city
    and country thence. Before Baliol college they showed us the stone in
    the street which marks the place of the barbarous martyrdom of the
    venerable archbishop Cranmer and bishop Ridley, then upon the banks of
    the ditch without the walls of the city, which went along where the
    theatre now stands. Beyond the river, amongst meadows encompassed with
    rivulets, stood Oseney abbey, founded by Robert D’oyley 1129.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> upon
    the bridge is a tower called Friar Bacon’s Study, from that famous and
    learned monk, who in dark ages had penetrated so far into the secrets
    of nature. Oxford, no doubt, means no more than the passage over the
    river Ox, Ouse, or Isis, which are equivalents. Over another bridge of
    the Isis we went to see Ruleigh abbey, where some ruins and parcels
    still remain, turned to a common brew-house: a disjointed stone in
    a partition wall preserves this monumental inscription, <span class="antiqua">Elae de
    Warwik comitissae viscera sunt hic</span>. This Ela was daughter of Wil.
    Longspee earl of Salisbury, and wife of Thomas de Newburgh the last
    earl <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>of Warwick of that name: she died on Sunday the fifth of the ides
    of February, 26 Ed. I. 1297. she gave lands to this abbey, and founded
    a chapel here, as appears by an inscription dug up 1705. her body was
    buried before the high altar at Oseney, her heart in this place. Of the
    castle there is a square high tower remaining by the river side, and a
    lofty mount or keep walled at top, with a stair-case going downward:
    this seems to have been a very strong place, built by Robert de Oili in
    the time of William the Conqueror. If there was a town here in Roman
    times, it seems to have been in this quarter. The White-friars was a
    royal palace; and near a green called Beaumonds, they showed us the
    bottom of a tower upon the ground where the valiant Richard I. <em>Cœur
    de lion</em>, was born. Without the town on all sides may be seen the
    remains of the fortifications raised in the time of the civil wars.
    It is in vain to pretend in this paper to enumerate the particular
    remarkables of every college, which are eighteen in number, and seven
    halls: these for beauty, grandeur, and endowment, no doubt, exceed any
    thing: their chapels, halls, libraries, quadrangles, piazzas; their
    gardens, walks, groves, and every thing, contribute to make the first
    university in the world. As to the city, though the colleges make up
    two thirds of it, and are continually eating it away, in buying whole
    streets for enlargement; yet it is large, regular, and crouds itself
    out proportionably: the streets are spacious, handsome, clean, and
    strait; the whole place pleasant and healthful; the inhabitants genteel
    and courteous: the churches are many and elegant enough, especially
    Allhallows, a neat fabric of modern architecture, with a very handsome
    spire. St. Peter’s in the east is venerable for its antiquity: the east
    end by its fabric appears prior to the time of the Conquest.</p>

  <p>Leaving this famous repository of learning, we saw on our left hand, on
    the other side of the river, the last ruins of Godstow nunnery, placed
    among the sweet meadows: here fair Rosamond, the beloved mistress of
    Henry II. had a tomb remarkably fine; but before the dissolution,
    scarce could her ashes rest, whose beauty was thought guilty even after
    death.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Woodstock.</div>

  <p>At Woodstock we saw part of the old palace, and her famous labyrinth,
    which is since destroyed: her bathing-place, or well (as called) is
    left, a quadrangular receptacle of most pure water, immediately flowing
    from a little spring under the hill, and over-shadowed with trees:
    near it some few ruins of walls and arches. King Ethelred called a
    parliament here; it has been a royal seat from most ancient times:
    Henry I. inclosed the park. A-cross this valley was a remarkably fine
    echo, that would repeat a whole hexameter, but impaired by the removal
    of these buildings. A stately bridge from hence now leads along the
    grand approach to the present castle: one arch is above a hundred foot
    diameter: a cascade of water falls from a great lake down some stone
    steps into the canal that runs under it.</p>

  <p>The new palace is a vast and magnificent pile of building; a royal gift
    to the high merit of the invincible duke of Marlborough; the lofty
    hall is painted by Sir James Thornhill; the salon by la Guerre: the
    rooms are finely enriched with marble chimney-pieces and furniture, but
    more by the incomparable paintings: many of Rubens’s best and largest
    pieces; that celebrated one of himself, his wife, and child, among
    others; Vandyke’s king Charles I. upon a dun horse, of great value;
    and the famous loves of the Gods, by Titian, a present from the king
    of Sardinia. The gallery I admired beyond any thing I have seen, lined
    with marble pilasters and whole pillars of one piece, supporting a most
    costly and beautiful entablature, excellent for matter and workmanship:
    the window frames of the same,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> and a basement of black marble quite
    round. Before it is stretched out a most agreeable prospect of the fine
    woods beyond the great valley: it is indeed of an admirable model:
    this, and what is of the most elegant taste in the whole house, is of
    the duchess’s own designing. The chapel is not yet finished, and which
    I doubt not will be equal to the rest. The garden is a large plot of
    ground taken out of the park, and may still be said to be part of it;
    well contrived by sinking the outer wall into a foss, to give one a
    view quite round, and take off the odious appearance of confinement
    and limitation to the eye, and which quite spoils the pleasure and
    intention of a garden: within, it is well adorned with walks, greens,
    espaliers, and visto’s to diremarkable objects that offer
    themselves in the circumjacent country. Over the pediment of this
    front of the house is a curious busto in marble of the French king,
    bigger than life, taken from the gate of the citadel of Tournay. The
    orangery is a pretty room. At the entrance hither from the town, her
    grace has erected a noble triumphal arch to the memory of the duke, and
    has projected a vast obelisk to be set in the principal avenue in the
    park, whereon is to be inscribed an account of his great actions and
    ability in council, and in war. Near the gate is the house where our
    famous Chaucer was born: methinks there was somewhat poetical in the
    ground that first gave him birth, and produced these verses, which I
    ask pardon for inserting, upon a subject which his genius only could be
    equal to:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>Fame, like the optic artist, wont to swell</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>The object larger to the armed eye,</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>Sing on, and mighty Marlborough’s actions tell:</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>Secure from flattery in words abound,</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>And let thy trumpet diapasons sound;</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>Speak but enough of him, ’tis all reality.</i></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Through the park we crossed again the Akeman-street, which runs all
    along with a perfect ridge made of stone, dug every where near the
    surface: it bears between north-east and east: it is a foot-path still
    through the park with a stile, and a road beyond it by which it passes
    to <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Stunsfield</span>, Ro. <i>town</i>.</span>Stunsfield,
    where are marks of an intrenched work, once a Roman
    station: and in the place they found (the 25th Jan. 1712.) a most
    curious tesselated pavement, for bulk and beauty the most considerable
    one we know of: it was a parallelogram of thirty-five foot long and
    twenty foot wide, a noble room, and no doubt designed for feasting and
    jollity: in one of the circular works was Bacchus represented in stones
    properly coloured, with a tiger, a <em>thyrsus</em> in his hand enwrapped
    with vine leaves. This admirable curiosity deserved a better owner;
    for the landlord and tenant quarreling about sharing the profits of
    showing it, the latter maliciously tore it in pieces. When the earth
    was first laid open upon its discovery, they found it covered a foot
    thick with burnt wheat, barley and pease: so that we may guess upon
    some enemy’s approach it was covered with those matters to prevent its
    being injured, or was turned into a barn and burnt.</p>

  <p>We crossed a foss called Grimesditch, the <em>vallum</em> eastward: it
    goes by Ditchley wood and house, which takes its name from it. Dr.
    Plot does not sufficiently distinguish this from a Roman road: it was
    doubtless some division of the ancient Britons: the country is all a
    rock of rag-stone. Many good seats of the nobility hereabouts; Cornbury
    lord Clarendon’s, Ditchley lord Litchfield’s, duke of Shrewsbury’s at
    Hathorp, new built of stone very beautiful. Juniper grows plentifully
    hereabouts. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> Chadlington is a square Roman camp. At Enston is a
    pretty curiosity in water-works, cascades falling down artificial rocks
    overgrown with waterplants, chirping of birds imitated, many pipes of
    water, secretly to dash the spectators, and fancies of that kind.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Chipping-norton.</span></div>

  <p>Chipping-Norton must have been a great trading town by the number of
    merchants, as they are there called, buried in the church under brasses
    and inscriptions: others of alabaster: and the name of the place
    signifies it, as our Cheapside, equivalent to market, to buying or
    cheapening. There are marks of a castle by the church, which probably
    was demolished in the time of king Stephen. Lord Arundel, beheaded in
    the barons wars, lived in it: a place called the Vineyards near it.
    Roman coins are frequently found here. The church is a good building of
    a curious model, the south porch hexagonal, and a little roof over it
    supported by a stone arch: under the choir is a charnel-house full of
    the ruined rafters of mortality. A priory was here near Chapel on the
    heath: the Talbot inn was religious: stories of subterraneous passages
    thence to the priory. A well lately found in the ploughed fields at
    Woodstock hill, a mile south of this place, and more such like in the
    fields. Hereabouts they call camps <em>barrows</em>, meaning boroughs.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Rowldrich.</span> Br. <i>temple</i>.</div>

  <p>Hence we rode to see Rowldrich stones, a very noble monument; the first
    antiquity of this sort that I had seen, and from which I concluded
    these works to be temples of the ancient Britons. I crave leave to
    reserve its description for another work. In the clay upon these
    hills they dig out <i lang="la">cornua ammonis</i>, small, but very prettily
    notched: they are nothing but clay hardened in the shell. Further on,
    in Tadmerton parish, we rode through a large round camp on the top of
    a hill doubly intrenched, able to contain a great army. Bloxham has a
    very fine church, the steeple of an odd make, but pretty enough. At
    Broughton near Banbury is the seat of the lord Say and Seal.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Branavis.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. VIII. 2d Vol.</div>

  <p>Banbury was a Roman station, called <em>Branavis</em>. That master
    builder the bishop of Lincoln, Alexander, built the castle anno 1125,
    I doubt not but upon the Roman fortification: he enlarged it and built
    it after the mode of those times, taking in a huge space of ground
    with a wall, towers and ditch: within he made another work upon one
    side, where were the lodgings, chapel, &amp;c. A small part of the wall of
    this is only now left, of good hewn stone; but the ditch went along
    the middle of the adjacent street, and houses are built by the side
    of it, out of its ruins, as people now alive remember: in the civil
    wars it received new additional works, for there are plain remains
    of four bastions; a brook running without them. Many Roman coins and
    antiquities have been found here. There is an inn called the Altarstone
    inn, from an altar which stood in a nich under the sign: this had a ram
    and fire carved on it, as they say: part of the stone is still left:
    I imagine this was originally a Roman altar: they tell us William the
    Conqueror lay at this inn. The town is a large straggling place and
    dirty, though on a rock with sufficient descent: one would think it
    was walled about in most ancient times. Here are three gates, though
    of later make. The tower of the church, they say, was much higher than
    at present: the church is of great compass: three rows of pillars, but
    of too slender a manner, which makes them all lean awry, and different
    ways: many additions have been made to it: a touch-stone monument of
    the family of Cope: other old monuments ruined. The bridge is long,
    consisting of many arches. <i>Branau supercilium aquæ</i> seems well
    to answer the etymology of the Roman name, as Mr. Baxter has it:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
    The stone of this country is mixed with sand. Black gloves is a great
    manufacture here. Kenric the West-Saxon king, anno 540, routed the
    Britons at this place.</p>

  <p>We went over the vale of Red-horse and Edghill, which presents us with
    a most extensive prospect, steep to the north: on the top of it, at
    Warmleighton, is a large and strong intrenchment of a circular but
    irregular form, said to be Danish by the inhabitants, but seemingly
    more ancient and British. Descending the hill for a mile, we rode
    through Radway, and over the field between it and Kyneton, where the
    famous battle of Edghill was fought: we were shown some of the graves
    of the slain. At Tellisford we crossed the Foss-way.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Præsidium.</span> Warwick.</div>

  <p>Warwick is situate on a rock, a fine new-built town, having been almost
    wholly burnt down in 1694. The church and lofty tower is new built,
    except the east end, which is old and very good work: there are a many
    fine brass monuments of the earls of Warwick and others, as the earl of
    Essex; <span class="sidenote">TAB. IX. 2d Vol.</span>many chapels and confessionaries, with other remains of ancient
    superstition: in the chapter-house on the north side is a tomb of the
    lord Brook. The castle stands upon the river Avon, over which is a
    stone bridge with a dozen arches: across is a large stone-work dam,
    where the water falls over it as a cascade, under the castle wall,
    which is built on a rock forty foot above the water. It overlooks the
    whole town and country, being delicately situate for pleasure and
    strength, fenced with a deep mound and strong embattled double walls
    and lofty towers: there are good apartments and lodgings next the
    river, the residence of the lord Brook: on one side of the area is a
    very high mount: we were shown the sword and other gigantic reliques
    of Guy the famous earl of Warwick. The priory on the north-east side
    of the town overlooks a pleasant woody vale: there are a great many
    curious original pictures, by Vandike and other good hands, of kings,
    queens, famous statesmen, persons of learning both at home and abroad.
    A mile out of town, on the side of a hill, is a pretty retired cell,
    called Guy-cliffe: in an old chapel there is a statue of Guy eight foot
    high: the fence of the court is intire rock, in which are cut stables
    and out-houses. We saw the rough cave where they say Guy died a hermit.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Coventry</span>.</div>

  <p>Coventry is a large old city: it was walled about: the gates are
    yet standing. It is adorned with a fine and very large church and
    beautiful spire a hundred yards high. There is another good church in
    the same yard. The cross is a beautiful Gothic work, sixty six foot
    high: in niches are the statues of the English kings. At the south end
    of the town stands a tall spire by itself, part of the Grey Friers’
    conventual church. The town-house is worth seeing: the windows filled
    with painted glass of the images of the old earls, kings, &amp;c. who have
    been benefactors to the town. Here the famous lady Godiva redeemed the
    privileges thereof almost at the expence of her modesty, the memory
    whereof is preserved by an annual cavalcade. These verses are wrote in
    the town-house.</p>

    <i>of</i> Wisbech, <i>M. D.</i></div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TO you of right I inscribe this journey, to which your company and my
    inclination to see somewhat of the world allured me. I had conceived
    great notions of the old Britons betimes, and longed to hear at least
    a language spoke soon after the deluge; and I then prided myself as
    much as Cæsar formerly in making this small inroad into their country.
    I willingly take this occasion of recognizing how I ought to esteem
    it a happiness, that you chanced to be seated in a place so near that
    of my nativity, and presented to me a subject of imitation, in all
    the commendable qualifications that may conduce to the felicity and
    ornament of life. Your deep insight into the <em>materia medica</em>, the
    theory and practice of physic, your great knowledge of antiquities,
    natural history, and all polite learning, and the excellence of your
    hand in designing, were as so many spurs to me in my young years, when
    we are most apt at imitation: and that the latter exercise of the pen
    is of importance to all the others, is too notorious, and universally
    allowed by all, to need any solemn proof. Who sees not that the defeats
    and confusion in anatomy and botany, and every part of philosophy,
    is owing to the want of drawing? when the innumerable labours of so
    many ages are either lost to posterity, or imperfectly transmitted,
    for that reason. How well does this range and distinguish ideas, and
    imprint them in one’s own mind, as well as make them known to others?
    It is not to be disputed but a person that understands it, sees much
    farther into things than others: the beauties of art and nature are
    open to him. Indeed every body is pleased with perfection and beauty,
    though they know not why: as suppose that of a fine statue, they are
    hugely delighted with it, though they understand not that it is owing
    to the proper disposition and contrast of the limbs, to the attitude,
    the grace of the posture, the expression of the action, the light and
    shade, and a thousand other requisites, as well as the particular
    delicacy and outline of the parts and members: and these things are
    only to be learnt and gathered from Nature’s self, from copying and
    observing it; for she is the grand exemplar of all fine strokes in
    drawing;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> as Aristotle formed his Art of Poetry from the great genius
    of Homer, and he from the force of Nature.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Grantham.</div>

  <p>Grantham was certainly a Roman town. Burton in his Commentaries on
    Antoninus’s Itinerary relates, that a great stone trough, covered
    with a stone, was dug up there, full of Roman coins, p. 216.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The
    street that runs on the east of the church is called Castle-street:
    between it and the river have been dug up foundations of a castle,
    as they say.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> I have a piece of glass with enamel upon it, ground
    with an engine; which is curious, and I take it for Roman: it was
    found in the Grange garden. Here is a spacious church and fine spire,
    much noted: it is a hundred yards high, equalled by another in this
    county, Louth, besides the tower of Boston: under the south wall of
    this church are two tomb-stones, said to be of the founders; one in old
    French, the date only legible, 1362; the other, <span class="antiqua" lang="la">hic jacent ricard
    de calceby et margareta vx ejus m ccclxii</span>. On a stone in a wall in
    Church-lane this inscription (the <em>orate pro anima</em> seems to have
    been cut out by order of some zealot) <span class="antiqua" lang="la">Iohis Goldsmyth mercatoris
    de Grantham</span>, a coat of arms, quarterly; in the sinister upper
    quarter a mullet. There were many religious houses here, some reliques
    of them left: in one just by the market-place is a very pretty little
    chapel, or oratory, adorned with imagery. The Angel inn was once a
    commandery. Here is a good free-school, erected by Richard Fox bishop
    of Winchester, where Sir Isaac Newton received the first principles of
    literature, under the famous William Walker then school-master.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
    Belvoir, the seat of the dukes of Rutland, stands on a high hill with a
    very fine prospect: you may see Nottingham castle and Lincoln minster,
    and all around you, below, many towns and lordships the demesnes of
    this noble family. Here is a perfect pattern of the true old English
    hospitality. In the fine gallery are many ancient and modern family
    pictures and others; the original one of king Charles I. as he sat at
    his trial. This place was the possession of Robert de Totney,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a
    great man who came in with William the Conqueror: he built a priory
    near it. I imagine originally here was a Roman camp; for coins have
    been found about it.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Upon the edge of Lincolnshire we visited the
    tombs of the duke of Rutland’s family at Bottesworth, which are worth
    seeing.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Nottingham.</div>

  <p>Nottingham we arrived at after crossing the Roman road called Foss:
    it is a pleasant and beautiful town. They have a great manufacture
    here for stockings, which they weave in looms from the invention of
    a neighbouring clergyman. Their ale is highly valued for softness
    and pleasant <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>taste: the cellars in the town are hewn out of
    the rock two or three story deep, to fourscore steps sometimes. The
    castle is a goodly building on a high perpendicular rock; seems to
    have been modelled after some of Inigo Jones’s draughts: many good
    pictures there: it commands a vast prospect. The south side of the
    rock is altogether inaccessible: a winding stair-case along it to the
    bottom, which they call Mortimer’s hole: there are vast subterraneous
    grottos cut underneath. St. Mary’s church is a fine old lightsome
    building, with a good ring of eight bells. We saw Mr. Hurst’s gardens,
    late Pierpoint’s, which are very pretty; in the middle a copy of the
    Dalmatian slave in metal. One may easily guess Nottingham to have
    been an ancient town of the Britons: as soon as they had proper tools
    they fell to work upon the rocks, which every where offer themselves
    so commodiously to make houses in; and I doubt not that here was a
    considerable collection of colonies of this sort: that which I have
    described in <a href="#i_053_1">Plate 39</a>.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXIX.</span> will give us an idea of them; it is in the
    duke of Newcastle’s park. What is visible at present is not of so old
    a date as their time; yet I see no doubt but that it is formed upon
    theirs: this is a ledge of perpendicular rock hewn out into a church,
    houses, chambers, dove-houses, &amp;c. The church is like those in the
    rocks at Bethlehem and other places in the Holy Land: the altar is
    natural rock, and there has been painting upon the wall; a steeple,
    I suppose, where a bell hung, and regular pillars. The river here
    winding about makes a fortification to it; for it comes to both ends
    of the cliff, leaving a plain before the middle. The way to it was by
    gates cut out of the rock, and with oblique entrance for more safety.
    Without is a plain with three niches, which I fancy their place of
    judicature, or the like: there is regularity in it, and seems to
    resemble that square called the Temple in the Pictish castle, <a href="#i_053_2">Plate
    38</a>.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXVIII.</span> in Scotland. The wild <em>cherry-tree</em> grows upon this place,
    and many curious plants, <em>liver-worts</em>, <em>lychnis sylvester</em>.
    9. <em>clus. ruta muraria</em>, <em>rosa pimpinellæ folio odorata</em>,
    <em>capillus veneris</em>, <em>umbilicus veneris</em>. Between this and the
    castle is an hermitage of like workmanship. The butchers shambles is
    an old edifice built for a granary. Clifton near here is a good seat,
    with pretty gardens and a noble prospect: in the church are many old
    brasses of the family of this name. Three miles from Nottingham is
    Woolaton hall, the seat of my lord Middleton; which is a good piece
    of old building: there is a pretty summer-house panelled and cieled
    with looking-glass, which produces a pleasant effect: underneath is a
    water-house with grotesque work of shells, &amp;c. A little beyond, in the
    road, upon the brow of the hill, is a high rugged piece of rock, called
    Hemlock-stone, seen at a good distance: probably it is the remains of a
    quarry dug from around it. Beyond this we entered Derbyshire. There are
    some few ruins of Dale abbey seated in a valley, and the east end of
    the choir over-grown with ivy: the mullions of the windows are knocked
    out (I suppose for sake of the iron:) it is overlooked by a near and
    high hill covered with oaks. In the ascent, out of the rock is cut a
    cell, or little oratory, called the Hermitage:<span class="sidenote">TAB. XIV.</span> on one side the door and
    windows, at the east end, a square altar and a step up to it of the
    same quarry, little niches cut in the wall, and a bench to sit on all round.</p>

  <p class="clear">Derby<span class="sidenote smcap clear">Derby.</span> has five churches; the tower of one is very fine. The new-erected
    silk manufacture is a remarkable curiosity: the house is of a vast
    bulk, five or six stories high: the whole furniture is one machine
    turned by a single water-wheel, which communicates its power through
    the whole, and actuates no less than 97–746 several wheels or motions,
    and still employs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> three or four hundred hands to over-look and act
    in concert with it. Mr. Loom the owner brought the design of it from
    Italy.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The waters that run here, whether from the lead mines or
    coal, are apt to cause the <em>bronchocele</em> in the fair sex.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Burton.</div>

  <p>Beyond Derby, along the Ricning way is Burton upon the Trent, where
    is a bridge of thirty-seven arches. Here was an old abbey: they are
    pulling down the ruins to build a new church.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Derventio.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXVI.</div>

  <p>A mile below Derby, upon the river Derwent, stood the old Roman city
    Derventio, now called Little Chester. I traced the track of the wall
    quite round, and in some places saw under ground the foundation of it
    in the pastures, and some vaults along the side of it: they dig it up
    daily to mend the ways with. Mr. Lord’s cellar is built on one side of
    the wall three yards thick: it is of a square form, standing between
    the Roman way called the Ricning street and the river. Within the walls
    are foundations of houses in all the pastures; and in the fields round
    the castle (as they call it) you may see the tracks of the streets
    laid with gravel: in a dry summer the grass over them is very bare.
    Divers wells are found, some still remaining, square, curbed with good
    stone. Brass, silver, and gold Roman coins have been found in great
    abundance; earthen pipes, aqueducts, and all kinds of antiquities.
    Towards the river they have dug up human bones, brass rings, and the
    like. There was a bridge over the river, for it was too deep and rapid
    for a ford: they can feel the foundations of it with a staff. In Mr.
    Hodgkin’s cellar a stag’s head with horns was dug up; probably a temple
    thereabouts: a square well in his garden three foot and a half one way,
    and four another.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Ricning-way.</span></div>

  <p>A little further northward upon the Ricning street,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> which seems to
    take its name from the Saxon <em>rige</em>, <em>dorsum</em>, is Horreston
    castle, whose ruins on a hoary rock are nearly obliterated; and out of
    it they cut great quantities of rubstones to whet scythes withal. We
    are now got into the very Peak of Derbyshire, the British Alps, where
    the odd prospects afford some entertainment to a traveller, and relieve
    the fatigue of so tedious a road. Now you pass over barren moors, in
    perpetual danger of slipping into coal-pits and lead-mines; or ride for
    miles together, on the edge of a steep hill, on solid slippery rock or
    loose stones, with a valley underneath, where you can scarce discover
    the bottom with your eye; which brought into my mind that beautiful
    in Virgil,</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="la">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>Saxa per &amp; scopulos &amp; depressas convalles.</i></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Instead of trees and hedges, they fence in their poor meadow or arable
    with walls of loose stones picked up from beneath their feet. The
    extended sides of the mountains are generally powdered over as it were
    with rocks, streams of water dribbling down every where; and now bolder
    cataracts diversify the romantic scene.</p>

  <p>At the smelting-mills they melt down the lead ore, and run it into a
    mould, whence it becomes pigs as they call it: the bellows continually
    are kept in motion by running water. We were complemented to be let
    down two hundred yards deep into the mines, if we pleased. We came to
    a monstrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> parcel of gigantic rocks, seemingly piled one a-top of
    another as in the wars of the gods, called the Torr: there were a few
    inhabitants at bottom, in little cottages, who durst trust themselves
    under so ruinous a shelter: it was fitly represented by those verses of
    the poet,</p>

  <p>I took the pains to clamber on hands and knees almost to the top, and
    entered another hermit’s cell, who had a mind, if possible, to get
    quite out of the world: it is hewn in the rock, with a most dreary
    prospect before it: on one end is a crucifix and a little niche, where
    I suppose the mistaken zeal of the starved anchorite placed his saint,
    or such trinket. Over-against it, about half a mile off, is another
    such cliff; but by the care of a gentleman that lives underneath (Mr.
    Ashe) it is reduced into a more agreeable form: there is an easy ascent
    up to it by steps hewn out of the rock, and abundance of alcoves,
    grots, summer-houses, cellars, pinacles, dials, balustrades, urns, &amp;c.
    all of the same materials: earth is carried to the top, and fine grassy
    walks with greens planted along them, upon this hanging terrace, whence
    you have a free view over many a craggy mountain. I was highly pleased
    with so elegant a composure, where Art and industry had so well played
    its part against rugged Nature.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Chatsworth.</div>

  <p>We went through Wirksworth, and over the rapid Derwent, whilst on a
    sudden (like the advantageous change of a scene) we were surprised at
    the sight of Chatsworth, the famous seat of the duke of Devonshire,
    deservedly reckoned one of the wonders of the Peak, as remarkable for
    its situation in so wild a place as its curious fabric and ornaments.
    The river here for a while puts on a smooth aspect, and glides gently
    by, as unwilling to leave so glorious a place: between it and the house
    is a fine venerable walk of trees, retaining the name of that great
    philosopher Hobbes, who studied frequently under its shade. A noble
    piece of iron-work gates and balusters exposes the front of the house
    and court, terminated at the corners next the road with two large stone
    pedestals of Attic work, curiously adorned with trophies of war, and
    utensils of all the sciences, cut in <em>basso relievo</em>. This face
    of the building is Ionic, the whole being a square of a single order,
    but every side of a different model: a court in the middle, with a
    piazza of Doric columns of one stone each overlaid with prodigious
    architraves. The stone is of an excellent sort, veined like marble,
    hewn out of the neighbouring quarries, and tumbled down the adjacent
    hill: it is introduced into the work in very large sizes, finely
    jointed. In the anti-room to the hall are flat stones, of fourteen
    foot square, laid upon the heads of four pillars, and so throughout:
    in the hall stairs the landing or resting steps of the same dimension:
    the doors, chimneys, window-cases, stairs, &amp;c. of marble; the sashes
    very large, gilt; the squares two foot broad: the cielings and walls
    of all the apartments charged with rare painting of Varrio and other
    famous hands: the bath-room all of marble curiously wrought. The
    chapel is a most ravishing place: the altar-end and floor marble, the
    seats and gallery cedar, the rest of the wall and cieling painted. The
    gardens abound with green-houses, summer-houses, walks, wildernesses,
    orangeries, with all the furniture of statues, urns, greens, &amp;c. with
    canals, basons and water-works of various forms and contrivance,
    sea-horses, drakes, dolphins, and other fountains that throw up the
    water: an artificial willow-tree of copper spouts and drops water from
    every leaf: a wonderful cascade, where, from a neat house of stone like
    a temple, out of the mouths of beasts, pipes, urns, &amp;c. a whole river
    descends the slope of a hill, a quarter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> of a mile in length, over
    steps, with a terrible noise and broken appearance, till it is lost
    under ground. Beyond the garden, upon the hills, is a park, and that
    overlooked by a very high and rocky mountain: here are some statues and
    other antiquities.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Buxton.</div>

  <p>Hence we went by Bakewel, and left Haddon-house belonging to the duke
    of Rutland on our left hand, in a pleasant and fruitful valley. We
    travelled ten miles over a perfect desert to Buxton, encompassed with
    waste and boggy mountains and naked cliffs: the tops of the hills
    hereabouts are quagmires, or springs, furnishing numerous rivers
    running hence all manner of ways. Nature seems to have thrown these
    precipicious heights into the middle of the island on purpose for her
    limbeck, to distil the liquid sources of springs by some unknown power.
    The valleys are the firmest ground, made of the gritty washings of
    the mountains: we were every moment diverted with the appearance of
    curious plants, but no tree to be seen. At Buxton are the admirable
    warm springs, which invite numbers of strangers yearly, especially
    from the northern countries. The duke of Devonshire has built a large
    and convenient house for their reception: the bath-room is arched over
    head, and the whole made handsome, convenient, and delightful. This
    collection of tepid waters, exceeding clear, will receive twenty people
    at a time to walk and swim in: the temper thereof, equal to new milk,
    or that of one’s own blood, procures a moderate perspiration: its
    effect is remarkable for giving that gentle relaxation of the solids,
    which takes off the weariness and fatigue of a journey, and refreshes
    immediately: it is useful physically in many cases, and may be indulged
    more than the hot baths of Somersetshire, which frequently do harm for
    that reason, through an imprudent use. Such a one as this was imitated
    by the sumptuous bagnios of the Roman emperors. Sir Tho. Delves, who
    received a cure here, gave the pump and a pretty stone alcove over the
    drinking-spring in the yard: the water may be raised to what height you
    please. Philosophers have long sought for a solution of the cause of
    these hot springs: the chymists know many mixtures will produce a flame
    and effervescence, particularly steel filings and sulphur, when water
    is poured thereon; but that these could continue the same course and
    quantity of water, and this regular heat, through all ages and seasons,
    is worthy of admiration. Indulgent Nature indeed has made some amends
    to the inhabitants of this barren region by this inestimable gift.
    We found in one of the rooms these verses, wrote upon the wall by a
    physician that formerly frequented the place:</p>

      </div>
    </div>

  <p class="noindent">About half a mile off is that stupendous cavern called Pool’s Hole,
    under a great mountain: the entrance at the foot thereof is very low
    and narrow, so that you must stoop to get in: but immediately it
    dilates into a wide and lofty concavity, which reaches above a quarter
    of a mile end-wise and farther, as they tell us: some old women with
    lighted candles are guides in this Cimmerian obscurity: water drops
    from the roof every where, and incrusts all the stones with long
    crystals and fluors: whence a thousand imaginary figures are shown you,
    by the name of lions, fonts, lanterns, organs, flitch of bacon, &amp;c. At
    length you come to the Queen of Scots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> pillar, as a <em>terminus</em> of
    most people’s curiosity. A stream of water runs along the middle, among
    the fallen rocks, with a hideous noise, re-echoed from all sides of the
    horrid concave: on the left hand is a sort of chamber, where they say
    Pool, a famous robber, lived. We may very well apply these verses to
    the place:</p>

  <p>We entered the pleasanter country of Cheshire at Lyme, the seat of
    Mr. Leigh: here are curious gardens, lakes, cascades, fountains,
    summer-houses. This is a fine level, woody, and rich county, abounding
    with lakes of water called meres: the towns stand but thin, and it
    being mostly inclosure, there are paved causeways for horses along
    the clayey roads: many ancient seats and parks, but most ruinous and
    decayed. We were entertained by the worthy Sir Francis Leycester at his
    seat, Nether Tabley, by Knutsford, upon the Roman way from Mancunium
    to Deva: this house stands in the midst of a mere: here is a good
    library completed by the curious possessor, with a vast addition to his
    ancestors’ store, of all the English history especially. In cleansing
    this mote some time since they found an old British axe, or some such
    thing, made of large flint, neatly ground into an edge, with a hole in
    the middle to fasten into a handle: it would serve for a battle-axe.
    Rotherston church stands upon a hill, and commands a lovely prospect
    across a mere, a mile and half in length and a mile over, where
    amongst great variety of fish are smelts found, properly inhabitants
    of the sea. There is a floating island, formed from turf, sustained by
    implication of the roots of <i>alnus nigra baccifera</i> growing on it,
    which the wind wafts over from one side to the other. On the south side
    of the steeple is this inscription:</p>

  <div class="center"><span class="antiqua">Orate pro anima domini willmi hardwicke vicarii istius ecclesiae<br>
    et pro animabus omnium parochianorum qui hoc sculpt.</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">Out of the church-yard you see to the Yorkshire hills beyond
    Manchester. By the church-porch were lately dug up three large stone
    coffins. In the church are abundance of coats of arms. Among other
    curious plants grow hereabouts <i>calamus aromaticus</i> and <i>ros
    solis</i>. The Roman road from Manchester to Chester passes the Mersey
    river at Stretford, through Altringham, to the north of Rotherston
    mere; then by Chapel in the street, by Winingham, to Northwich; then by
    Sandy way, the Chamber or Edesbury, it passes the river at Stanford, so
    called from the stony ford, to Chester.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Condate.</div>

  <p>We were at Northwich, which I take to be Condate, as all distances
    persuade me. It is still, among others hereabouts, famous for
    brine-springs, whence they make great quantities of finest salt, by
    boiling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> water in large iron pans of small depth: as fast as the
    salt crystallises, they rake it out and dry it in conic wicker baskets:
    the duty paid by it amounts to a great sum of money. About thirty years
    ago on the south side of the town they discovered immense mines of
    rock salt, which they continually dig up, and send in great lumps to
    the maritime parts, where it is dissolved and made into eating-salt.
    We were let down by a bucket a hundred and fifty foot deep to the
    bottom of the salt quarry, a most pleasant subterraneous prospect: it
    looks like a large cathedral, supported by rows of pillars and roof
    of crystal, all of the same rock, transparent and glittering from the
    numerous candles of the workmen, labouring with their steel pick-axes
    in digging it away: this rock-work of salt extends to several acres
    of ground. There is a very good church in the town: the end of the
    choir is semicircular: the roof of the church is very fine, whereon
    are carved several of the wicker baskets before mentioned; whence they
    report it was built out of the profits of the salt works. At Lawton
    Yates they bore for the salt spring to sixty yards deep; lower down, at
    Hassal, it is forty seven; at Wheeloc, eighteen; about Middlewich it is
    less; at Northwich it arises to open day; which seems to intimate that
    the salt spring runs between layers of the earth in an horizontal line:
    upon boring, it rises with great impetuosity, so that the workmen have
    scarce time to get out of the wells. This is all along the side of a
    brook that comes from a remarkable hill called Mawcop, upon the edge
    of Staffordshire, so that the ground rises above the true level in the
    mentioned proportion.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Mancunium.</div>

  <p>Manchester, in Lancashire, is the <em>Mancunium</em> of the Romans,
    the largest, most rich, populous, and busy village in England. There
    are about two thousand four hundred families. The site of the Roman
    <em>castrum</em>, between Sir John Bland’s and Manchester, is now called
    Knock Castle. They have a fabulous report of Turquin a giant living
    there, killed by Sir Lancelot de Lake, a knight of king Arthur’s: in it
    was found a Saxon ring, mentioned in Hickes’s <cite>Thesaurus</cite>, now in
    possession of Sir Hans Sloan. A Roman altar dug up here, described by
    Dr. Lister, Philos. Trans. N. 155. p. 457. and a large gold Roman ring.
    The Castle field, as sometime called, is about as big as Lincoln’s-Inn
    square, the foundation of the wall and ditch remaining. Some call it
    Man-castle: its name comes from the British <em>maen</em>, <em>lapis</em>,
    meaning its rocky soil. The old church, though very large, having
    three rows of neat pillars, was not capable of containing the people
    at divine service; whence they raised, by voluntary subscriptions, a
    new edifice after the London models, finished last year: the choir
    is alcove-fashion, and the pilasters painted of <em>lapis-lazuli</em>
    colour. There is a fine new street built to the north. Their trade,
    which is incredibly large, consists much in fustians, girth-web,
    tickings, tapes, &amp;c. which is dispersed all over the kingdom, and to
    foreign parts: they have looms that work twenty-four laces at a time,
    which was stolen from the Dutch. The college has a good library for
    public use, endowed with 116l. per ann. to buy more books, and a salary
    for the librarian. There is a free-school maintained by a mill upon the
    river, which raises 300l. per annum. On the same river, for the space
    of three miles upwards, there are no less than sixty water-mills. The
    town stands chiefly on a rock; and across the river is another large
    town, called Salthorp. Dr. Yarburgh, son to him late of Newark, showed
    me a great collection of old Greek, Persian, Tartarian, and Punic coins
    brought from Asia. About a mile off, at the seat of Sir John Bland, is
    a Roman altar, lately dug up thereabouts: in the mosses, as they call
    them in this country, they often find reliques<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> of antiquity, such as
    arrow-heads, celts, pick-axes, kettles, &amp;c. of brass; many are in the
    repository of the library: likewise subterraneous fir-trees, as in most
    other countries in the like sort of ground. French wheat grows commonly
    hereabouts, much used among the poor people, of very different species
    from ours: they have likewise wheat with long beards like barley, and
    barley with four rows of grain on an ear, and great plenty of potatoes.</p>

  <p>We passed through Delamere forest, upon the Roman road, in our way
    to Chester. They say here was formerly an old city, now called the
    Chamber on the Forest; I suppose, some fort or camp to secure the road.
    From hence you have a fine prospect to the Welsh mountains, such a
    noble scene of nature as I never beheld before. Beeston castle is on
    our left, built upon a rocky precipice.<span class="sidenote smcap">Deva.</span> Chester is a fine old city,
    and colony of the Romans, the residence some time of the <i>legio
    vicesima victrix</i>: a hypocaust was lately found, lined with bricks
    made by that legion. I need not repeat what other authors say of the
    antiquities at this place. The rows or piazzas are singular, through
    the whole town giving shelter to foot people. I fancied it a remain
    of the Roman porticos. Four churches beside the cathedral, which is
    a pile venerable indeed for age and almost ruin: there are shadows
    of many pictures on the walls, <em>madonnas</em>, saints, bishops, &amp;c.
    but defaced. At the west end are some images of the earls Palatine
    of Chester in niches. The adjoining abbey is quite ruined. The walls
    round the city are kept in very good repair at the charge of the
    corporation, and serve for a pleasant airy walk. The Exchange is a neat
    building, supported by columns, thirteen foot high, of one stone each:
    over it is the city-hall, a well-contrived court of judicature. The
    castle was formerly the palace, and where the earls assembled their
    parliaments, and enacted laws independent of the kings of England,
    and determined all judicial trials themselves. Abundance of Roman and
    British antiquities are found hereabouts. At Stretton, Roman coins,
    and a camp-kettle of copper dug up at Codington: near it divers other
    antiquities. The old Watling-street way from Dover came originally
    hither through Stretton and Aldford; though I suppose in after-times of
    the Romans they turned it off more southward into Wales, for sake of
    the many towns seated on the Severn.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Wales.</div>

  <p>Next we entered Wales, and came to Wrexham in Flintshire. Here is a
    good church, and the finest tower-steeple I ever saw, except Boston:
    it is adorned with abundance of images. There is a new town-house
    built like that at Chester. The common people speak the Welsh. The
    gentry are well-bred, hospitable, generous and open-hearted: the
    females are generally handsome. I took a great deal of pleasure in
    hearing the natives talk in their own language, and remarked a great
    many words among them still retained in our country of Lincolnshire
    Holland: it is probable enough that our fens and morasses might be
    a long security to us against the Saxons, as it had been to them
    against the Romans. I shall give instances of a few words. When we
    put oatmeal into water-gruel or milk, we call it <em>lithing</em> the
    pot: the same is signified by the Welsh word <em>llith</em>. Davis
    thinks the English <em>slide</em> comes from the British <em>llithro</em>,
    <em>labi</em>: we call it <em>slither</em>. A <em>bull-beggar</em>, or
    <em>boggleboe</em>, is manifestly the British <em>bwbach</em>, with all
    its synonymes. A top we call a <em>whirligig</em>, purely British. We
    say a <em>whisking</em> fellow, dexterous, ready: British <em>gwisgi</em>,
    To <em>whyne</em>; British <em>gwynio</em>. Very many such like occur in
    Dr. Skinner’s <cite>Etymologicum</cite>, which he would fain persuade us
    the Welsh learnt from the Saxons, <span class="sidenote smcap">Bonium.</span>but without reason. We passed by
    the valley upon the river Dee, where was the famous British monastery
    in early times, whereof Pelagius was abbot, whose British name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> was
    Morgan; but no remains discernible. What some talk concerning it,
    probably the vestiges of the Roman city; for many foundations, coins,
    and antiquities have been dug up; and not long since two gates of the
    city were left. We entered Shropshire, passing by Ellsmere and Wem
    to Newport, where is a noble foundation for a school well endowed
    by William Adams esq; to the value of 7000l. over the door is this
    distich, <i lang="la">in fundatorem</i>:</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">he gave 550l. towards building the town-house.</p>

  <p>Presently entering Staffordshire, we came into the Watling-street, laid
    very broad and deep with gravel not yet worn out, where it goes over
    commons and moors. It is raised a good height above the soil, and so
    strait, that upon an eminence you may see it ten or twenty miles before
    you, and as much behind, over many hill-tops answering one the other as
    a visto of trees. Here and there, between one Roman town and another,
    you meet with the remains of an old fort or guard-place. We lodged
    at an inn called Ivesey bank, on the borders between Staffordshire
    and Shropshire. About a mile off, in a large wood, stands Boscobel
    house, where the Pendrils lived, who preserved king Charles II. after
    Worcester fight, and famous for the Royal Oak.<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Royal Oak.</span></span> The grand-daughter of
    that William Pendril still lives in the house. The floor of the garret
    (which is a popish chapel) being matted, prevents any suspicion of a
    little cavity with a trap-door over the stair-case, where the king was
    hid: his bed was artfully placed behind some wainscot that shut up very
    close. A bow-shot from the house, just by a horse-track passing through
    the wood, stood the Royal Oak into which the king, and his companion
    colonel Carlos, climbed by means of the hen-roost ladder, when they
    judged it no longer safe to stay in the house; the family reaching them
    victuals with the nut-hook. It happened (as they related it to us)
    that whilst these two were in the tree, a party of the enemy’s horse,
    sent to search the house, came whistling and talking along this road:
    when they were just under the tree, an owl flew out of a neighbouring
    tree, and hovered along the ground as if her wings were broke, which
    the soldiers merrily pursued without any circumspection. The tree is
    now inclosed within a brick wall, the inside whereof is covered with
    laurel; of which we may say, as Ovid did of that before the Augustan
    palace, <i lang="la">mediamque tuebere quercum</i>. The oak is, in the middle,
    almost cut away by travellers whose curiosity leads them to see it:
    close by the side grows a young thriving plant from one of its acorns.
    The king, after the restoration, reviewing the place, carried some of
    the acorns, and set them in St. James’s park, or garden, and used to
    water them himself: he gave this Pendril an estate of about 200l. per
    annum, which still remains among them. Over the door of the inclosure I
    took this inscription cut in marble.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

  <p>Entering Staffordshire, we went along the Watling-street by
    Stretton and Water-Eaton: where a brook crosses the road was the
    <span class="sidenote smcap">Pennocrucium.</span><em>Pennocrucium</em> of the Romans, as mentioned in the Itinerary of
    Antoninus. A little way off is Penkridge, which no doubt retains
    somewhat of the ancient name.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Litchfield.</div>

  <p>Litchfield is a city neat enough. The cathedral is a very handsome
    pile, with numerous statues in niches at the front, which appears very
    majestic half a mile off, there being two high spires, and another
    higher in the middle of the cross. The rebels intirely ruined all the
    ornament of the inside, with the brass inscriptions, tombs, &amp;c. and
    were going to pull down the whole fabric for sale. It is built in the
    middle of a bog for security, and held out some fierce attacks for
    king Charles I. This was made a metropolitical see by the potent king
    Offa. St. Ceadda lived an eremitical life here by the spring near Stow
    church. This town arose from the ruin of the Roman <span class="sidenote smcap">Etocetum.</span><em>Etocetum</em>,
    a mile off, where the Rickning and Watling streets cross, now called
    Chesterfield wall, from some reliques of its fortifications: it stands
    high: the Rickning street is very visible southward, passing within a
    mile of Fotherby, and so to a park in Sutton Colfield, Warwickshire;
    thence to Bromicham. Castle hill, two miles hence above Stone hall,
    is a camp, the port eastward. A mile and half from Wall is West-wall,
    a camp; and Knaves-castle, near the Watling-street, probably a guard
    upon the road: it is a circle of twenty yards diameter, with a square
    in the middle, three or four yards broad, with a breast-work about it:
    the whole is inclosed with three ditches: it stands in a large common.
    This Rickning is all along called by Dr. Plot <em>Icknilway</em>, but
    injuriously, and tends only to the confusion of things; I suppose,
    to favour his <em>Iceni</em> in this country; which notion is but
    chimerical. We passed through Tamworth, pleasantly situated in a
    plain watered by the river Tame, which divides it into two counties:
    it was the residence of the Mercian kings, and has been secured by a
    <em>vallum</em> and ditch quite round. Here died the noble lady Elfleda,
    daughter of king Alfred, queen of the Mercian kingdom, anno 919. This
    town, by William the Conqueror, was given to the Marmyons, who built
    the castle here, hereditary champions to the kings of England; from
    whom that office descended to the Dymokes of Lincolnshire. We went
    through Bosworth over the field where Henry VII. won the kingdom by a
    bold and well-timed battle.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">TO you, Sir, that have visited the boasted remains of Italy, and
    other transmarine parts, it would seem presumptuous to offer the
    trifle of the following letter, were I not sufficiently apprized of
    your great humanity and candour, which prompts you to encourage even
    the blossoms of commendable studies. You, that have made an intimate
    search, and happily obtained a thorough insight into Nature, consider
    that she proceeds regularly by successive gradations from little
    things to greater. The acquisition of any part of science is owing
    to a conversation with its elements and first principles, whose very
    simplicity renders them not disagreeable.</p>

  <p>These pages were memoradums I took in a summer’s journey with our
    friend Mr. Roger Gale. This being my first expedition since I came
    to live at London, I design as early as possible to commemorate the
    felicity I enjoyed thereby of your acquaintance, and the opportunity of
    observing the noble character you sustain, of possessing all the wisdom
    that ancient or modern learning can give us without vanity, and that
    the physician, the scholar, and the gentleman, meet in you.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Bibroci.</div>

  <p>I observe, in Berkshire, a river called Ock, running in the north side
    of the county by Abingdon into the Thames, which in the Celtic language
    signifies sharp or swift, or perhaps water in general: this is in Oke
    hundred. In the south side of the county is the town of Okeingham.
    These seem plainly remnants of the old name of the inhabitants of
    this country, <em>Bibroci</em>, not yet observed. Near Reading is
    Laurence-Waltham, which has been Roman: there is a field called
    Castle-field, and vast numbers of coins found. By it is Sunning, once
    an episcopal see. From London to Maidenhead it is a gravelly soil; then
    a marly chalk begins.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Reading.</div>

  <p>Reading is a large and populous town upon the fall of the Kennet into
    the Thames; in the angle of which it stands upon a rising ground,
    overlooking the meadows, which have a fine appearance all along the
    rivers. There are three churches, built of flint and square stone in
    the <em>quincunx</em> fashion, with tall towers of the same. Arch-bishop
    Laud was born here. The abbey stood in a charming situation: large
    ruins of it still visible, built of flint; the walls about eight
    foot thick at present, though the stone that faced them be pillaged
    away: the remainder is so hard cemented, that it is not worth while
    to separate them: many remnants of arched vaults a good height above
    ground, whereon stood, as I suppose, the hall, lodgings, &amp;c. there
    is one large room about sixteen yards broad, and twenty-eight long,
    semi-circular towards the east end, with five narrow windows,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>three doors towards the west, and three windows over
    them: it was arched over, and seems to have supported a chapel, in
    which we fancy king Henry I. was buried with his queen: he founded
    this abbey upon an old one, that had been formerly erected by a <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXVI.</span>Saxon
    lady. There are the remains of bastions, part of the fortifications,
    when garrisoned by the parliament army in the civil wars: <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXIII.</span>the abbey
    gate-house is yet pretty intire. Here was a famous old castle, but
    long since demolished, perhaps originally Roman. Near the trench the
    Danes made between the river Kennet and the Thames, is Catsgrove hill,
    a mile off Reading: in digging there they find first a red gravel,
    clay, chalk, flints, and then a bed of huge petrified oysters five
    yards thick, twenty foot below the surface: these shells are full of
    sea sand.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Dr. Plot, in <em>Oxfordshire</em>, p. 119. who supposes
    these appearances only the sports of Nature, solves this matter after
    a way that will induce one to think his cause reduced to extremity. On
    the right hand, just beyond Theal, is Inglefield, where king Ethelwolf
    routed the Danes.</p>

  <p class="clear">A little west of Newberry<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Ad Spinam.</span></span> is a village called Speen; which has given
    antiquarians a reasonable hint of looking for the town, in Antoninus
    called <span class="sidenote">TAB. LX.</span><em>ad Spinas</em>, hereabouts; and doubtless it was where now
    stands the north part of the town of Newberry, still called Spinham.<span class="sidenote">TAB. X. 2d Vol.</span>
    At this place the great Icening-street road, coming from the Thames
    at Goring, and another Roman road running hence through Speen to
    Hungerford, and so to Marlborough, crosses the Kennet river. Newberry
    has derived itself and name from the ruins of the old one; and the
    grounds thereabouts are called Spinham lands. Dunington castle was
    once in the possession of Geffrey Chaucer. A remarkable large oak,
    venerable through many ages, because it bore his name, was felled in
    the civil wars. The Kennet, still called by the country people Cunnet,
    near Hungerford, parts the soil, that on the north side being a red
    clay gravel, that on the south a chalk. I have often wished that a map
    of soils was accurately made, promising to myself that such a curiosity
    would furnish us with some new notions of geography, and of the theory
    of the earth, which has only hitherto been made from hypotheses.
    This brings into my mind a remarkable passage in Sir Robert Atkins’s
    <em>Glocestershire</em>: “Lay a line (says he) from the mouth of the
    Severn to Newcastle, and so quite round the terrestrial globe, and
    coal is to be found every where near that line, and scarce any where
    else.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Cunetio.</div>

  <p>From Newberry the Roman road (I believe coming from Silchester) passes
    east and west to Marlborough, the Roman<span class="sidenote">TAB. LXII. LXIII.</span>
    <em>Cunetio</em>,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> named
    from the river. This town consists chiefly of one broad and strait
    street, and for the most part upon the original ground-plot; nor does
    it seem unlikely that the narrow piazza<span class="sidenote">TAB. XI. 2d vol.</span> continued all along the sides
    of the houses is in imitation of them: the square about the church in
    the eastern part one may imagine the site of a temple fronting this
    street: to the south are some reliques of a priory: the gate-house is
    left: on the north has been another religious house, whereof the chapel
    remains, now turned into a dwelling-house. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>Where now is the seat of my
    lord Hartford was the site of the Roman <em>castrum</em>, for they find
    foundations and Roman coins; I saw one of Titus in large brass: but
    towards the river, and without my lord’s garden-walls, is one angle of
    it left very manifestly, the rampart and ditch intire: the road going
    over the bridge cuts it off from the limits of the present castle: the
    ditch is still twenty foot broad in some part: it passed originally on
    the south of the summer-house, and so along the garden-wall, where it
    makes the fence, to the turn of the corner: the mark of it is still
    apparent broader than the ditch, which has been repaired since, but of
    narrower dimension: then I suppose it went through the garden by the
    southern foot of the mount, and round the house through the court-yard,
    where I have marked the track thereof with pricked lines in <a href="#i_063_5">Plate 62</a>.
    There is a spring in the ditch, so that the foss of the <em>castrum</em>
    was always full of water. I suppose it to have been five hundred Roman
    feet square within, and the Roman road through the present street of
    Marlborough went by the side of it. Afterward, in Saxon or Norman
    times, they built a larger castle, upon the same ground, after their
    model, and took in more compass for the mount; which obliged the road
    to go round it with a turn, till it falls in again on the west side
    of the mount at the bounds of Preshute parish. Roman coins have been
    found in shaping the mount; which was the keep of the later castle,
    and now converted into a pretty spiral walk, on the top of which is an
    octagonal summer-house represented<span class="sidenote">TAB. I.</span> Tab. I. This neighbouring village,
    Preshute, has its name from the meadows the church stands in, which
    are very low: in the windows upon a piece of glass is written, DNS
    RICHARDUS HIC VICARIUS, who I believe lived formerly in a little house
    at Marlborough, over-against the castle, now an ale-house, where his
    name is cut in wood in the same old letters over the door.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Leucomagus.</div>

  <p>Great Bedwin I take to be the <em>Leucomagus</em> of Ravennas; for that
    and the present name signify the same thing, viz. the white town,
    the soil being chalk: he there places it just before Marlborough,
    <em>cunetzione</em>. We saw near it the continuation of Wansdike.<span class="sidenote">TAB. LXIV.</span> This
    town is an old corporation: in it the famous Dr. Tho. Willis, the
    ornament of our faculty, was born. In the church lies the monument of a
    knight cross-legged; on his shield, barry of six argent and gules, an
    orle of martlets sable; over all three escallops of the first on a bend
    of the third. Upon a stone in brass in the choir,</p>

    made by the Wansdike. They showed us a brass town gallon, from the
    Winchester standard, given by my lord Nottingham. In the east window
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> this church some time since was the picture of a priest with
    two crutches, a cup in his hand, and a cann standing by him, with

    out of an old MS. now in the library of Holkham in Norfolk, formerly
    Sir Ed. Coke’s book; and for its antiquity I think it not unworthy of
    mentioning.</p>

  <p class="noindent">We were entertained at Wilton, the noble seat of the great earl of
    Pembroke; and deservedly may I style it the School of Athens. The
    glories of this place I shall endeavour to rehearse in a separate
    discourse.</p>

  <p>Crekelade, probably a Roman town upon the Thames; for from this a
    very plain Roman road runs to Cirencester. Much has been the dispute
    formerly about a fancied university in this place, and the little town
    in its neighbourhood <em>Latin</em>, which it would be senseless only
    to repeat. The word <em>Crekelade</em> is derived from the cray-fishes
    in the river: <em>Lade</em> is no more than a water-course, but more
    especially such a one as is made by art;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and we here find the
    river pent up for a long way together by factitious banks, in order
    the better to supply their mills: so <em>Latin</em> is no more than
    <em>ladeings</em>, or the meadows where these channels run. Ledencourt,
    near Newent, Glocestershire, I suppose, acknowledges the like original;
    and many <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>more. The town of Lechelade falls under the same predicament:
    <em>leche</em> signifies a watery place subject to inundations; as Leach,
    a town near Boston before mentioned, anciently written <em>Leche</em>:
    as Camden says of Northleach, p. 240. and Litchfield hence fetches its
    etymology from the marshy bog that environs the church, rather than the
    superstitious notion there current. Not far hence are two towns called
    Sarney and Sarncote, from the Roman causeway; <em>sarn</em> in Welsh
    importing a paved way. There is another upon the same road between
    Cirencester and Glocester.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Corinium.</span> Dobunorum</div>

  <p>Cirencester was anciently the <em>Corinium</em> of the Romans, a great
    and populous city, built upon the intersection of this road we have
    been traveling, and the great Foss road going to the Bath: it was
    inclosed with walls and a ditch of a vast compass, which I traced quite
    round. Under the north-east side of the wall runs the river Churn,
    whence the names of the town: the foundation of the wall is all along
    visible; the ditch is so where that is quite erased.</p>

  <p class="noindent">A great part of the ground comprehended within this circuit is now
    pasture, corn-fields, or converted into gardens, beside the site of
    the present town. Here they dig up antiquities every day, especially
    in the gardens; and in the plain fields, the track of foundations of
    houses and streets are evident enough. Here are found many Mosaic
    pavements, rings, intaglia’s, and coins innumerable, especially in one
    great garden called <em>lewis</em> grounds, which signifies in British
    a palace, <em>llys</em>. I suppose it was the <em>prætorium</em>, or head
    magistrate’s quarters. Large quantities of carved stones are carried
    off yearly in carts, to mend the highways, besides what are useful in
    building. A fine Mosaic pavement dug up here Sept. 1723. with many
    coins. I bought a little head which has been broke off from a <i>basso
    relievo</i>, and seems by the <em>tiara</em>, of a very odd shape, like
    fortification work, to have been the genius of a city, or some of
    the <i lang="la">deæ matres</i>, which are in old inscriptions, such like in
    Gruter, p. 92. The gardener told me he had lately found a fine little
    brass image, I suppose one of the <em>lares</em>; but, upon a diligent
    scrutiny, his children had played it away. Mr. Richard Bishop, owner
    of the garden, on a hillock near his house, dug up a vault sixteen
    foot long and twelve broad, supported with square pillars of Roman
    brick three foot and a half high; on it a strong floor of terras: there
    are now several more vaults near it, on which grow cherry-trees like
    the hanging gardens of Babylon. I suppose these the foundations of a
    temple; for in the same place they found several stones of the shafts
    of pillars six foot long, and bases of stone near as big in compass
    as his summer-house adjoining (as he expressed himself): these, with
    cornices very handsomely moulded and carved with modilions, and the
    like ornaments, were converted into swine-troughs: some of the stones
    of the bases were fastened together with cramps of iron, so that they
    were forced to employ horses to draw them asunder; and they now lie
    before the door of his house as a pavement: capitals of these pillars
    were likewise found, and a crooked cramp of iron ten or twelve foot
    long, which probably was for the architraves of a circular portico.
    A Mosaic pavement near it, and intire, is now the floor of his
    privy vault. Mr. Aubury in his MS. coll. says an hypocaust was here
    discovered; and Mr. Tho. Pigot, fellow of Wadham, wrote a description
    thereof. Sometimes they dig up little stones, as big as a shilling,
    with stamps on them: I conjecture they are counterfeit dies to cast
    money in.</p>

  <p>We saw a monumental inscription upon a stone at Mr. Isaac Tibbot’s, in
    Castle-street, in very large letters four inches long:</p>

  <p class="noindent">It was found at a place half a mile west of the town, upon the north
    side of the Foss road, called <em>Quern</em> from the quarries of stone
    thereabouts. Five such stones lay flatwise upon two walls in a row,
    end to end; and underneath were the corpses of that family, as we
    may suppose. He keeps Julia Casta’s skull in his summer-house; but
    people have stole all her teeth out for <em>amulets</em> against the
    ague. Another of the stones serves for a table in his garden: it is
    handsomely squared, five foot long and three and a half broad, without
    an inscription. Another of them is laid for a bridge over a channel
    near the cross in Castle-street. There were but two of them which had
    inscriptions: the other inscription perished, being unluckily exposed
    to the wet in a frosty season: probably, of her husband. Several urns
    have been found thereabouts, being a common burying place: I suppose
    them buried here after christianity. In the church, which is a very
    handsome building of the style of St. Mary’s at Cambridge, are a great
    many ancient brass inscriptions and figures: the windows are full of
    good painted glass: there is a fine lofty tower. Little of the abbey
    is now left, beside two old gate-houses neither large nor good: the
    circuit of it is bounded for a good way by the city walls. East of the
    town about a a quarter of a mile, is a mount or barrow called Starbury,
    where several gold Roman coins have been dug up, of about the time of
    Julian, which we saw: some people ploughing in the field between it and
    the town, south of the hill, took up a stone coffin with a body in it
    covered with another stone. West of the town, behind my lord Bathurst’s
    garden, is another mount, called Grismunds or Gurmonds, of which
    several fables are told: probably raised by the Danes when they laid
    siege to this place.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Glevum.</div>

  <p>Hence our journey lay by Stretton over the continuation of the Roman
    road from Crekelade, which appears with a very high ridge and very
    strait for eight miles, to Birdlip hill, prodigiously steep and rocky
    to the north-west, till we came to Glocester, a colony of the Romans.
    The old proverb, <span class="sidenote">TAB XXXII.</span>“As sure as God’s at Glocester,” surely meant the vast
    number of churches and religious foundations here; for you can scarce
    walk past ten doors but somewhat of that sort occurs. <span class="sidenote">TAB. XII. 2d Vol.</span>The western part
    of the cathedral is old and mean; but from the tower, which is very
    handsome, you have a most glorious prospect eastward through the choir
    finely vaulted at top, and the Lady’s chapel, to the east window, which
    is very magnificent: here, on the north side, lies that unfortunate
    king, Edward II. and out of the abundance of pious offerings to his
    remains, the religious built this choir: before the high altar in the
    middle thereof lies the equally unfortunate prince Robert, eldest
    son of William the Conqueror, after a miserable life: but he rests
    quietly in his grave; which cannot be said of his younger brother,
    Henry I. before spoken of at Reading abbey: he has a wooden tomb over
    him, painted with his coats of arms, and upon it his effigies, in
    Irish oak, cross-legged like a Jerusalem knight. The cloysters in this
    cathedral are beautiful, beyond any thing I ever saw, in the style of
    King’s-college chapel in Cambridge. Nothing could ever have made me so
    much in love with Gothic architecture (as called); and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> judge, for
    a gallery, library, or the like, it is the best manner of building;
    because the idea of it is taken from a walk of trees, whose branching
    heads are curiously imitated by the roof. There are large remains of
    several abbeys of black and white friers, &amp;c. I saw this distich cut in
    wood over an old door of a house:</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">This city abounds much with crosses and statues of the kings of
    England, and has a handsome prospect of steeples, some without a
    church. Here are several market-houses supported with pillars; among
    the rest a very old one of stone, Gothic architecture, uncommon and
    ancient, now turned into a cistern for water. A mile or two distant
    from the city is a very pleasant hill, called Robin Hood’s: I suppose
    it may have been the rendezvous of youth formerly to exercise
    themselves in archery upon festivals, as now a walk for the citizens.
    By this city, the <em>Glevum</em> of the Romans, the Ricning-street way
    runs from the mouth of the Severn into Yorkshire. I have nothing new as
    to its Roman antiquities; and since that is out of dispute, I hasten to
    Worcester.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Branonium.</div>

  <p>It was anciently called <em>Branonium</em>, which the Welsh corrupted
    into <em>Wrangon</em>, prefixing <em>Caer</em>, as was their method; and
    thence our <em>Worcester</em>: it signifies the city <i lang="la">ad frontem
    aquæ</i>. The commandery here, formerly belonging to St. John’s of
    Jerusalem, is now possessed by the hospitable My. Wylde: it is a fine
    old house of timber in the form of a court: the hall makes one side
    thereof, roofed with Irish oak: the windows adorned with imagery and
    coats armorial of stained glass: built for the reception of pilgrims:
    it stands just without the south gate of the city in the London road,
    where the heat of the famous battle happened between king Charles II.
    and Oliver Cromwell. Digging in the garden they frequently find the
    bones of the slain. Above, in the park, is to be seen a great work,
    of four bastions, called the Royal Mount, whence a <em>vallum</em>
    and ditch runs both ways to encompass this side of the city. Here I
    suppose the storm began, when the Royalists were driven back into the
    city with great slaughter; and the king escaped being made a prisoner
    in the narrow street at this gate (as they say) by a loaded cart of
    hay purposely overthrown; by that means he had time to retire at the
    opposite gate to an old house called White Ladys, being formerly a
    nunnery in possession of the family of Cookseys, where he left his
    gloves and garters, which a descendant of that family, of the same
    name, now keeps. The chapel of this nunnery is standing, and has some
    painted saints upon the wall of one end. A mile and half above the
    south gate, on the top of the hill, is the celebrated Perry wood, where
    Oliver Cromwell’s army lay.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XVIII.</div>

  <p>The collegiate church is stately enough: in it is buried the restless
    king John; not where now his monument stands in the choir before the
    high altar, but under a little stone before the altar of the eastermost
    wall of the church; on each side him, upon the ground, lie the effigies
    of the two holy bishops and his chief saints Wolstan and Oswald, from
    whose vicinity he hoped to be safe from harm: the image of the king
    likewise I suppose formerly lay here upon the ground, now elevated
    upon a tomb in the choir as aforesaid. There is a large and handsome
    stone chapel over the monument of prince Arthur, son of Henry VII. on
    the south side of the high altar. The cloysters are very perfect, and
    the chapter-house is large, supported, as to its arched roof, with
    one umbilical pillar: it is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> become a library well furnished,
    and has a good many old manuscripts. There is a large old gate-house
    standing, and near it the castle, with a very high artificial mount or
    keep nigh the river. We met here with an odd instance of a prodigious
    memory, in a person the powers of whose soul are run out (as we may
    speak) intirely into that one; for otherwise his capacity is very weak:
    if we name any passage in the whole Bible, he will immediately tell you
    what book, chapter, and verse, it is in; a truly living concordance.
    Here are a great many churches, and in good repair: one steeple is
    octangular, another is remarkable for its lofty spire. A large bridge
    of six arches over the beautiful Severn, enriched on both sides with
    pleasant meadows. This is a large city, very populous and busy, and
    affords several fine prospects, particularly from Perry wood. No doubt
    but this was a Roman city; yet we could find no remains, but a place in
    it called Sidbury, which seems to retain from its name some memorial of
    that sort.</p>

  <p>A Roman road goes hence along the river to Upton, where antiquities
    are dug up, (I take it for <span class="sidenote smcap">Ypocessa.</span><em>Ypocessa</em> of Ravennas) and so to
    Tewksbury, where it meets with the Ricning-street way. A little below
    Worcester a river called Teme falls into the Severn; and many other
    synonymous rivers there are in England, beside the great Thames,
    which shows it a common name to rivers in the old Celtic language,
    and the same with the Greek Ποταμος, the first syllable cut off. A
    little above, a river called Saltwarp falls into the Severn from
    Droitwich, a Roman town, which occurs too in Ravennas under the name
    of <span class="sidenote smcap">Salinis.</span><em>Salinis</em>; and they still make salt at the place. From hence
    I made an excursion to <span class="sidenote smcap">Malvern.</span>Great Malvern, a considerable priory at the
    bottom of a prodigious hill of that name: the church is very large and
    beautiful, with admirable painted glass in all the windows, and several
    old monuments: upon a stone now in the body of the church, but taken
    from without the south side in a garden, which was anciently the south
    wing, this.</p>

  <p class="noindent">there is a carved stone image, by the south wall of the choir, of
    very rude and ancient workmanship: it is a knight covered with mail
    and his surcoat; in his right hand a halbert like a pick-axe, in his
    left a round target. Here are many coats of arms and cognizances upon
    a glazed sort of brick; such I have seen at other places. A handsome
    gate-house is left, and from the houses in the town you command a very
    noble prospect over Worcester, as far as Edghill, as they tell us: it
    is thought the Malvern has metals in its bowels. We diverted ourselves,
    as we rode through Dean forest, with a house after the primitive style,
    built round an oak tree, whose branches are still green with leaves.

  <p>The city of Hereford probably sprung up from the ruin of the Roman
    <span class="sidenote smcap">Ariconium.</span><em>Ariconium</em>, now Kenchester, three miles off, higher up the
    river Wye, but not very near it; which may be a reason for its decay.
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXV.</span>Ariconium stands upon a little brook called the Ine, which thence
    encompassing the walls of Hereford falls into the Wye. Two great
    Roman ways here cross each other: one called the Port-way comes
    from <em>Bullæum</em>, now Buelt, in Radnorshire; passing eastward
    by Kenchester, through Stretton, over the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>river Lug, to Stretton
    Grantham upon the Frome, it goes to Worcester: the other road comes
    from the south, and Abergavenny, <em>Gobannium</em>, by Old town formerly
    <em>Blescium</em>; so by Dowre a-cross the Golden vale and Archenfield
    to the river Wye, which it passes at Eaton, where is a Roman camp for
    security, and a bridge for convenience of the passage: thence it goes
    to Kenchester, so northwards by Stretford: this Archenfield seems to
    retain the name of Ariconium. Nothing remaining of its splendour, but
    a piece of a temple probably, with a niche which is five foot high
    and three broad within, built of Roman brick, stone, and indissoluble
    mortar: the figure of it is in the fore-mentioned plate. There are
    many large foundations near it. A very fine Mosaic floor a few years
    ago was found intire, soon torn to pieces by the ignorant vulgar.
    I took up some remaining stones of different colours, and several
    bits of fine potters ware of red earth. Mr. Aubury in his manuscript
    notes says, anno 1670, old Roman buildings of brick were discovered
    under-ground, on which oaks grew: the bricks are of two sorts; some
    equilaterally square, seven or eight inches, and one inch thick; some
    two foot square, and three inches thick. A bath was here found by Sir
    John Hoskyns about seven foot square: the pipes of lead intire; those
    of brick were a foot long, three inches square, let artificially one
    into another: over these I suppose was a pavement. This is an excellent
    invention for heating a room, and might well be introduced among us
    in winter time. In another place is a hollow, where burnt wheat has
    been taken up: some time since colonel Dantsey sent a little box full
    of it to the Antiquarian Society. All around the city you may easily
    trace the walls, some stones being left every where, though overgrown
    by hedges and timber trees. The ground of the city is higher than the
    level of the circumjacent country. There appears no sign of a foss
    or ditch around it. The site of the place is a gentle eminence of a
    squarish form; the earth black and rich, overgrown with brambles,
    oak trees, full of stones, foundations, and cavities where they have
    been digging. Many coins and the like have been found. Mr. Ja. Hill,
    J. C. has many coins found here, some of which he gave to the said
    society. Colonel Dantsey has paved a cellar with square bricks dug
    up here: my lord Coningsby has judiciously adorned the floor of his
    evidence-room with them. This city is overlooked and sheltered towards
    the north with a <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Credonhill.</span> Br. <i>camp</i>.</span>prodigious mountain of steep ascent crowned at the
    top with a vast camp, which ingirdles its whole <em>apex</em> with works
    altogether inaccessible: it is called Credon hill, seemingly British:
    if you will take the pains to climb it, you are presented with a
    most glorious and extensive prospect, as far as St. Michael’s mount
    in Monmouthshire; bipartite at top, Parnassus-like, and of especial
    fame and resort among the zealots of the Roman creed, who think this
    holy hill was sent hither by St. Patrick out of Ireland, and has
    wonderful efficacy in several cases. On the other hand you see the vast
    black mountain separating Brecknockshire from this county: the city
    Ariconium underneath appears like a little copse. On the other side
    of the Wye you see Dinder hill, whereon is a Roman camp: and upon the
    Lug are <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sutton walls.</span> Ro. <i>camp</i>.</span>Sutton walls, another vast Roman camp upon a hill overtopping
    a beautiful vale, the royal mansion of the most potent king Offa,
    but most notorious for the execrable murder of young king Ethelbert,
    allured thither under pretext of courting his daughter, and buried in
    the adjacent church of Marden, situate in a marsh by the river side:
    hence his body was afterwards conveyed to Hereford and enshrined; but
    the particular place we cannot find. I suppose this martyr’s merits
    were obliterated by the succeeding saint,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> Cantilupe, the great
    miracle-monger on this side the kingdom, as his tutor and namesake
    Thomas Becket was in Kent.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Hereford.</div>

  <p>In the north wing of the cathedral of Hereford is the shrine where
    Cantilupe was buried, and which wing he himself built: his picture
    is painted on the wall: all around are the marks of hooks where the
    banners, lamps, reliques, and the like presents, were hung up in his
    honour; and, no doubt, vast were the riches and splendor which filled
    this place; and it is well guarded and barricadoed to prevent thieves
    from making free with his superfluities: the shrine is of stone, carved
    round with knights in armour; for what reason I know not, unless
    they were his life-guard. I saw a book, printed at St. Omar’s, of no
    little bulk, which contained an account of his miracles. The church
    is very old and stately, the roof, ailes, and chapel, have been added
    to the more ancient part by succeeding bishops, as also the towers,
    cloysters, &amp;c. The most beautiful chapter-house of a decagonal form,
    and having an umbilical pillar, was destroyed in the civil wars. I
    saw its poor remains, whence I endeavoured to restore the whole in
    drawing as well as I could, from the symmetry and manner of the fabric,
    which I guess to be about Henry the Sixth’s time: there are about four
    windows now standing, and the springing of the stone arches between, of
    fine rib-work, which composed the roof; of that sort of architecture
    wherewith King’s-college chapel at Cambridge is built: two windows were
    pulled down, a very little while ago, by bishop Bisse, which he used
    in new fitting up the episcopal palace: under the windows in every
    compartment was painted a king, bishop, saint, virgin, or the like;
    some I found distinct enough, though so long exposed to the weather.
    Here are the greatest number of monuments of the bishops I ever saw,
    many valuable brasses and tombs, one of Sir Richard Penbrug, knight of
    the garter, which I drew out for Mr. Anstis: in our Lady’s chapel, now
    the library, a fine brass of Isabella the wife of Richard Delamare, ob.
    1421. Between the cathedral and episcopal palace is a most venerable
    pile, exceeding it in date, as I conjecture from its manner of
    composure; built intirely of stone, roofed with stone: it consists of
    two chapels, one above the other: the ground-plot is a perfect square,
    beside the portico and choir: four pillars in the middle, with arches
    every way, form the whole: the portico seems to have a grandeur in
    imitation of Roman works, made of many arches retiring inwards: two
    pillars on each side consist of single stones: the lowermost chapel,
    which is some steps under ground, is dedicated to St. Catharine, the
    upper to St. Magdalen, and has several pillars against the wall, made
    of single stones, and an odd eight-square cupola upon the four middle
    pillars: there have been much paintings upon the walls: the arched roof
    is turned very artfully, and seems to have a taste of that kind of
    architecture used in the declension of the Roman empire.</p>

  <p>The city of Hereford stands upon a fine gravel, encompassed with
    springs and rivulets, as well as strong walls, towers, and lunettes;
    all which, with the embattlements, are pretty perfect, and enabled them
    to withstand a most vigorous siege of the Scots army under general
    Lesley. The castle was a noble work, built by one of the Edwards
    before the Conquest, strongly walled about, and ditched: there is
    a very lofty artificial keep, walled once at top, having a well in
    it faced with good stone: by the side of the ditch arose a spring,
    which superstition consecrated to St. Ethelbert: there is a handsome
    old stone arch erected over it. Without the walls are the ruins of
    Black Friers monastery, and a pretty stone cross intire; round which
    originally were the cloysters built, as now the cloysters of the
    cathedral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> inclose another such. These crosses were in the nature of
    a pulpit, whence a monk preached to the people <em>sub dio</em>, as is
    now practised once a year in the cloysters of some colleges in the
    universities; and I suppose Paul’s cross in London was somewhat of this
    sort. There was likewise an opulent priory, dedicated to our country
    saint, Guthlac of Crowland, now intirely ruined: the situation of it in
    a marshy place best suited him. White Friers on the other side the town
    is intirely ruined: a gate-house and several other parts were seen by
    many now living. All these religious conventions (as tradition goes)
    had subterraneous passages into the city under the ditch, that the holy
    fraternities might retire from the fury of war, upon occasion.</p>

  <p>In our way from Hereford to Leominster we ascended with some difficulty
    the mighty Dynmaur hill, the meaning of which appellation is the great
    hill: it makes us some amends for the tediousness of climbing, by the
    extensive and pleasant prospect it affords us from its woody crest
    commanding a vast horizon.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Leominster.</div>

  <p>Leominster is a town of brisk trade in manufactures of their admirable
    wool, in hat-making, leather, and many others; it lies in a valley
    luxuriant above measure. Three rivers of very swift current go
    through the town, besides others very near: nor will the industrious
    inhabitants suffer the water-nymphs that preside over the streams to be
    idle: for with mills, and machinery of various contrivance, they make
    them subservient to many uses in the way of their trades. Here was a
    considerable priory on the north-side of the church, two ailes of which
    are very ancient, and I suppose belonged to the priory: two other ailes
    of more lightsome work have been added. The mayor, who invited us to
    attend him thither, had a long black <em>caduceus</em> to walk withall,
    tipped with silver. <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXII.</span>There are some poor remains of the priory, chiefly
    a little chapel, which I imagine belonged to the prior’s family:
    underneath it runs a pretty rivulet, which used to grind his corn,
    now converted to a fulling-mill: near are very large ponds for fish,
    to furnish the monks on fasting days. There was a fine gate-house,
    pulled down not long since, near the Ambry close, denominated from the
    place (Almery) in which they gave their scraps away to poor people at
    the gate, as I have observed at several other religious houses: this
    is reckoned a great argument of their charity, whilst idle folks lost
    their time in waiting for it. Round the cross built of timber I saw
    this inscription, <i lang="la">Vive deo gratus, toti mundo tumulatus, crimine
    mundatus, semper transire paratus</i>, and some more stuff of that
    sort. In this town the soil is luxuriant above measure: trees of all
    sorts flourish prodigiously: we were surprised at the extravagant bulk
    of plants, leaves of dock as big as an ordinary tea-table, comfry
    leaves as long as my arm. Mr. Gale and I disputed a good while about
    borage quite grown out of cognizance.</p>

  <p>We were entertained by my lord Coningsby at his seat of Hampton-court,
    three miles off: at dinner time, one of the ancient bards in an
    adjacent room played to us upon the harp, and at proper intervals threw
    in many notes of his voice, with a swelling thrill, after a surprising
    manner, much in the tone of a flute. This is a fine seat, built by our
    countryman Harry of Bolingbroke, afterwards Henry the Fourth: it is,
    castle like, situate in a valley, upon a rapid river under coverture
    of Dynmaur: the gardens very pleasant, (the finest greens I ever saw)
    terminated by vast woods covering all the sloping side of the hill;
    whose wavy tops, when agitated by the wind, entertain the eye with a
    most agreeable spectacle, and verdant theatric concavity, as high,
    and as far, as you can well see. Here is a great command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> of water,
    on all sides of the house, for fountains, basons, canals: within are
    excellent pictures of the earl’s ancestors, and others, by the best
    hands; Holbein, Dobson, Van Dyke, Sir P. Lely, &amp;c. there is an original
    of the founder, Henry the Fourth, of queen Elizabeth, of the duchess
    of Portsmouth, &amp;c. The windows of the chapel are well painted, some
    images of the Coningsbys: here are two new stone stair-cases after a
    geometrical method, with a view, I suppose, of security from fire: the
    record-room is at top of a tower arched with stone, paved with Roman
    brick; an iron door. From the top of the house goes a stair-case,
    which they say has a subterraneous conveyance into Dynmaur wood;
    which was the method of ancient times to escape the last extremity of
    a siege. After dinner my lord did us the honour to ride out with us
    into the park, which for beauty, diversity, and use, is very fine: it
    is eight miles in circumference, and has all the variety of scenes
    you can imagine; about 1200 head of deer in it: there are extensive
    prospects, on one side reaching into Wiltshire; on another, over the
    Welsh mountains; lawns, groves, canals, hills and plains. There is a
    pool three quarters of a mile long, very broad, included between two
    great woods: the dam that forms it across a valley, cost 800l. and
    was made in a fortnight by 200 hands. There is a new river cut quite
    through the park, the channel of which for a long way together is
    hewn out of the rock: this stream enriches with derivative channels
    vast tracts of land that before was barren. Here are new gardens and
    canals laid out, and new plantations of timber in proper places to
    complete its pleasures; warrens, decoys, sheep-walks, pastures for
    cattle, and the like, intirely supply the house with all necessaries
    and conveniences, without recourse to a market. His lordship showed us
    in his study four or five vast books in manuscript, being transcripts
    out of the record-offices, relating to his manors, royalties, estates
    and muniments, which cost him 500l. in writing and fees: many of his
    galleries and passages are adorned with the genealogy of his family,
    their pictures, arms, grants, history, &amp;c. The Roman road from
    Ariconium to Uriconium lies west of Lemster by Stretford; then passes
    over the Arrow, the Oney, the Lug; so through Biriton, two miles north
    of Lemster, where they dig up the pavement of it, as it runs through
    the grounds, made of squarish rag-stone.</p>

  <p class="clear"><span class="sidenote smcap">Ludlow.</span>Our next expedition was to Ludlow, a place of fame and antiquity, the
    residence of the lords presidents of Wales under the prince. In the
    way hither we found the <i>euonymus pannonicus</i> in the hedges. This
    town is walled quite round, and pretty strong, having five gates,
    situate upon a hill-top, running from south-east with an ascent towards
    north-west, on which, precipitous to the north and west, stands the
    castle. On the south side runs the Teme, fettered with numerous dams
    across, in nature of cataracts; by which means abundance of mills are
    turned: the superfluous water pours over them, cascade-like, with a
    mighty noise. Here is a very good church and handsome tower, with a
    pleasant ring of six bells in the cross thereof: the windows are full
    of painted glass pretty intire: there are some old monuments of the
    lords presidents, &amp;c. and an inscription upon the north wall of the
    choir relating to prince Arthur, who died here: his bowels were buried
    in this place: one told me they took up his heart not long since in a
    leaden box. In the eastern angle of the choir is a closet, anciently
    called the <em>God-house</em>, where the priests locked up their roods,
    wafers, and such things: it has a window strongly barred outward. This
    church is consecrated to St Laurence: and in the market-place is an
    hexagonal cistern, or conduit, like a cross; on the top of which is a
    long stone cross, bearing a niche with an image of that saint in it.
    West of the church was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> college, now converted to a dwelling-house,
    whose owner showed us a pretty collection of pictures, one by Holben.
    There was a rich priory out of the town on the north side; small ruins
    now to be seen, except a little adjoining church once belonging to it:
    about the same place an arched gate-way went cross the street, but
    now demolished. The <span class="sidenote">TAB. IV. V.</span>greatest rarity of Ludlow is the noble and strong
    castle and palace, placed on the north-west angle of the town upon a
    rock, commanding a delightful prospect northward; but on the west,
    where runs the river, it is overlooked by a high hill. It is strongly
    environed by embattled walls of great height and thickness, with
    towers at convenient distances: that half which is within the walls
    of the town is secured moreover with a deep ditch; the other founded
    on the solid rock. It is divided into two separate parts; the castle,
    properly so speaking, wherein the palace and lodgings; and the green,
    or out-work, what I suppose they call the Barbican: the first is in
    the strongest or north-west corner, and has likewise walls and ditch
    hewn out of the rock towards the green: this was the residence of the
    lords presidents: it was a noble structure, but now, alas! only groans
    out with its last breath the glories of its ancient state. A chapel
    here has abundance of coats of arms upon the panels; so has the hall,
    together with lances, spears, firelocks and old armour; but the present
    inhabitants live upon the sale of the timber, stone, iron, and other
    materials and furniture, which dwindles away insensibly. Here died
    prince Arthur. The green takes in a large compass of ground, wherein
    was formerly the court of judicature and records, the stables, garden,
    bowling-green and other offices; all which now lie in ruins, or are let
    out at rack-rents to those that pilfer what they can: over several of
    the stable-doors are queen Elizabeth’s arms, the earls of Pembroke’s,
    and others.</p>

  <p>Hence we went along the river Teme to Tenbury. In a niche in the
    chancel is a stone, a yard long, of a child of lord Arundel’s of
    Sutton-house, as they say, dressed like a knight, cross-legged: another
    knight cross-legged under the south wall of the church; on his shield
    a chevron between three stars pierced. In the meadow, upon the river,
    a <em>tumulus</em> covered with old oaks, called Castle-mead bower, or burrow.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Bewdley.</div>

  <p>Bewdley is a pleasant town by sweet meadows upon the Severn, which is
    the most delightful river I have seen. Here, upon a hill over-looking
    the town, is Tickenhall, built by Henry VII. for his son prince
    Arthur; part of the old palace is standing, of timber-work: here was
    a park too, part of Wire forest. This is a thriving town. A mile off
    is Ribsford, the seat of the lord Herbert of Cherbury, pleasantly
    encompassed with woods. Here is a good picture of William I. earl
    of Pembroke: the ends of the hills toward the river are generally
    rocks. Blackston hill has an hermitage cut out of it, <span class="sidenote">TAB. XIII. XIV.</span>with a chapel
    and several apartments, which I have represented in prospect and
    ground-plot: near it is a pretty rock upon the edge of the water,
    covered with Nature’s beautiful canopy of oaks and many curious
    plants: near the water, upon the rock, <em>liver-wort</em> grows
    plentifully. They dig up coal hereabouts, about twelve yards under
    ground. Kederminster is but two miles off: in the church a cross-legged
    monument of Sir Tho. Acton. In Wulverhampton church are several old
    monuments; a brass statue of Sir Richard Leveson, who fought the
    Spaniards under Sir Francis Drake: there is a very old stone pulpit,
    and a very old stone cross in the church-yard. Was I to chuse a country
    residence for health and pleasure, it would be undoubtedly on the west
    side of the island, not far from this river, and where it is most
    distant from the sea; for natural reasons, which I need not mention to you.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE journey I here present your lordship is intirely Roman; for I went
    from London full northward to the banks of the Humber, upon the famous
    Hermen-street road, passing through Lincoln: then coasting about a
    little, at Lincoln again I took the Foss way to its intersection of the
    Watling-street in Warwickshire: upon that I returned back to London,
    and pursued it to the sea-coasts of Kent: likewise some part of the
    Icening-street, as it crosses the others, where it lay not too far
    out of my main route, was the subject of my enquiry: so that in this
    account is somewhat of all these four great roads of Britain, which our
    old monkish writers make a considerable harangue about, but are scarce
    able fully to distinguish them, and of the reason of their names say
    but little to our satisfaction: but the ways themselves, as drawn quite
    a-cross the island in different directions, are sufficiently manifest
    to a traveller of common sagacity. Though my discoveries herein are
    mean enough, yet I reckon this an happy <em>æra</em> of my life, because,
    the very day before I undertook it, I had the good fortune to be
    known to your lordship, and at the end of it enjoyed the pleasurable
    repose of your delightful seat at Eastwel, but what is more, your own
    conversation: since then your many favours, like all other felicities
    in life, give me uneasiness in the midst of joy, as sensible of my own
    little merit. I have no hope indeed of retaliating; and I know that
    great minds like yours imitate Providence, expecting no return from its
    beneficiaries: but it is consentaneous to human nature to endeavour at
    it, and offer tokens of gratitude, however unequal. The delight you
    take in rescuing the monuments of our ancestors, your indefatigable
    zeal in collecting them, your exquisite knowledge in the Greek, Roman,
    and British antiquities, and especially your great love for those of
    your own country, which you continually commit to writing in your
    private commentaries, add a reputation to these studies, and make the
    Muses hope for a sunshine, when men of your lordship’s noble birth
    entertain them with that familiarity and condescension which was one
    great glory of the Augustan age.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">Roman <em>roads</em>.</div>

  <p>For arts military and civil, that became a most wise government, the
    Romans beyond compare exceeded all nations; but in their roads they
    have exceeded themselves: nothing but the highest pitch of good sense
    and public spirit could prompt them to so immense a labour: it is
    altogether astonishing to consider how they begirt the whole globe,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
    as it were, with new meridians and great circles all manner of ways; as
    one says,</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="la">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>Magnorum fuerat solers hæc cura Quiritum</i></div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">As well as use, they studied eternity in all their works, just opposite
    to our present narrow souls, who say, It will serve our time well
    enough. For this reason they made few bridges, as liable to decay;
    but fords were laid with great skill and labour, many of which remain
    firm to this day without any reparation. No doubt but the Romans
    gave names to these roads from the commanders under whose government
    and direction they were laid out, as was their custom elsewhere: but
    because they generally held their posts here but for a short time, and
    perhaps scarce any finished one road intirely; therefore, whilst each
    endeavoured to stamp his own name upon them, so it fell out that they
    were all forgotten. The present appellatives seem to be derived either
    from the British or Saxon: William the Conqueror calls them <i>Chemini
    majores</i> in confirming the laws of St. Edward about these four ways.
    All misdemeanours committed upon them were decided by the king himself.
    Though there was no need of paving or raising a bank in some places,
    yet it was done for a perpetual direction; and every where I suppose
    stones were set at a mile’s distance, many of which are still left.
    Of these four celebrated ways, the Foss and Icening-street traverse
    the kingdom from south-west to north-east, parallel to one another:
    the Watling-street crossed them quite the contrary way, with an equal
    obliquity: the Hermen-street passed directly north and south: and
    besides these are very many more. I purpose not to give a full history
    of them here, any farther than I travel upon them, reserving that till
    I am better able.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Hermen-street.</span></div>

  <p>Somewhat on the Hermen-street is said already in my first letter
    about Lincolnshire, where it divides itself into two, which we may
    call the old and the new branch. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LVI.</span>Here I design to search it up to
    its fountain-head. As to its name, we have no reason to seek any
    farther than the Saxon language, where <em>Here</em> signifies an army;
    <em>Hereman</em>, a soldier or warriour:<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the Hermen-street then is
    the military street, in the same propriety the Romans used it. It
    begins at Newhaven, at the mouth of the river Ouse in Sussex, and
    passes on the west side the river through Radmil, probably taking its
    name thence; so through Lewis by Isfield: then it seems to pass over
    the river at Sharnbridge, as we may guess by its name, and so proceeds
    to East Grinsted, but I suppose lost in passing through the great
    woods: then through Surrey it goes by Stane-street, Croydon, Stretham,
    and, by its pointing, we may suppose was designed originally to pass
    the Thames at the ferry called Stangate by Lambeth, where it coincides
    with the Watling-street. Of this I can say nothing yet, having not
    travelled it. There I apprehend the road went before London became
    very considerable; but when the majesty of the place suddenly arose to
    great height, this road, and all others directed this way, deflected a
    little from their primitive intention, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>to salute the <em>Augusta</em>
    of Britain, destined to be the <i lang="la">altera Roma</i>; and this has
    rendered them all obscure near the city. It is generally thought the
    Hermen-street goes hence through Bishopsgate, and along the northern
    road; but I apprehend that to be of much later standing than the
    original one, which goes more on the west. By the quotation I mentioned
    in my first letter, when upon this road, out of Mr. Gale’s Itinerary,
    of Lowlsworth near Bishopsgate, it seems as if it was done in Lollius
    Urbicus his time. The original one perhaps passes through unfrequented
    ways near Enfield and Hermen-street, seeming to retain the old name: on
    the eastern side of Enfield chace, by Bush hill, is a circular <span class="sidenote">Br. <i>camp.</i></span>British
    camp upon an eminence declining south-west; but our ancient road
    appears upon a common on this side of Hertford by Ball’s park, and so
    passes the river below Hertford; then goes through Ware park, and falls
    into the present road on this side Wadesmill,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and so to Royston.
    Here must have been several stations upon it, but I see no hope of ever
    retrieving their names: that Hertford is one is reasonable to think, it
    having been ever in the royal demesne, and passing a river at a proper
    distance from London: but in the assignment of <em>Durocobrovis</em>
    here, I take leave to dissent from Camden and other learned men; it
    by no means answers the distances in the Itinerary, or the import of
    the name; the Red Ford, or the Ford of Harts, are fancies without
    foundation: either <i lang="la">trajectus militaris</i> is the meaning, or it is
    the passage of the river Ard, now the Beane: Ardley at the spring-head
    of it: <em>ardh</em> in British is <em>altus</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Icening-street.</span></div>

  <p>At Royston the Icening-street crosses the Hermen-street, coming from
    Dunstable going into Suffolk: this about Baldock appears but like a
    fieldway, and scarce the breadth of a coach, the farmers on both sides
    industriously ploughing it up: between Baldock and Icleford it goes
    through an intrenchment, taking in the top of a hill of good compass,
    but of no great elevation: it consists of a <em>vallum</em> only,
    and such a thing as I take to be properly the remains of a British
    <em>oppidum</em>: it is called <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wilbury.</span> Br.</span>Wilbury hill, and is said to have been
    woody not intirely beyond memory: this street, quite to the Thames in
    Oxfordshire, goes at the bottom of a continued ridge of hills called
    the Chiltern, being chalk, the natural as well as civil boundaries
    between the counties of Hertford and Bedford, very steep northward.
    Ickleford retains the name of the street, which at this place passes a
    rivulet with a stoney ford wanting reparation. Near Periton church has
    been a castle of Saxon or Norman times, with a keep. These high chalk
    hills, having a fine prospect northward, are covered with a beautiful
    turf like the Wiltshire downs, and have such like barrows here and
    there, and indeed are but a continuation of them quite a-cross the
    kingdom. Near Hexton is a square <span class="sidenote">Ro. <i>camp.</i></span>Roman camp upon a <em>lingula</em>, or
    promontory, just big enough for the purpose: it is very steep quite
    round, except at a narrow slip where the entrance is; double ditched,
    and very <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>strong, but land-locked with hills every way, except to
    the north-east, and that way has a good prospect: under it is a fine
    spring: it seems made by the Romans when they were masters of all the
    country on this side, and extending their arms northward. On High downs
    is a pleasant house by a wood, where is a place called Chapel close: in
    this wood are barrows and dikes, perhaps of British original. Liliho
    is a fine plot of ground upon a hill steep to the north-west, where a
    horse-race is kept: from under it goes the Icening-street by Stretley
    to Dunstable. North of Baldoc we visited the camp by Ashwel, taken
    notice of in Camden, called <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Harbury Banks.</span> Br.</span>Harbury banks: it is of a theatrical form,
    consisting wholly of an <em>agger</em>: though Roman coins have been
    found in it, I am inclinable to think it is earlier than their times.
    Between Calcot and Henxworth, two miles off, several Roman antiquities
    have been dug up this year; many in the custody of my friend Simon
    Degg, esq; he gave me this account of it: some workmen, digging gravel
    for the repair of the great northern road, struck upon some earthen
    vessels, or large urns, full of burnt bones and ashes, but rotten:
    near them a human skeleton, with the head towards the south-east, the
    feet north-west: several bodies were found in this manner not above a
    foot under the surface of the earth, and with urns great or small near
    them, and <em>pateras</em> of fine red earth, some with the impression
    of the maker on the bottom: there were likewise glass lachrymatories,
    <em>ampullas</em>, a <em>fibula</em> of brass, six small glass rings, two
    long glass beads of a green colour, and other fragments.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Salinæ.</span></div>

  <p>Northward still upon a high sandy hill, by the bank of the river Ivel,
    is a Roman camp called Chesterton: under it lies the town called
    Sandy, or Salndy, the <em>Salinæ</em> of the Romans in Ptolemy, where
    great quantities of Roman and British antiquities have been found,
    and immense numbers of coins, once a brass <em>Otho</em>, vases, urns,
    lachrymatories, lamps. Mr. Degg has a cornelian intaglia, and a British
    gold coin dug up here, <em>Tascio</em> upon it. Thomas Bromsal esq. has
    a fine silver <em>Cunobelin</em> found here, of elegant work; others of
    Titus, Agrippina, Trajan, Hadrian, Augustus, Antoninus Pius, Faustina,
    Constantius Chlorus, Constantinus Magnus, Carausius, Alectus, Tetricus,
    and many more.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> His great grandfather, high-sheriff of this county,
    preserved the invaluable Cottonian library from plunder in the time of
    the commonwealth, whilst it was at Stratton in this county, about anno
    1650. The soil here is sand, perfectly like that on the sea shore. I
    imagine a Roman road passed by this place westward from Grantchester by Cambridge.</p>

  <p>Return we to Royston again. Going upon the Icening-street the other
    way, just upon the edge of Cambridgeshire, we come to Chesterford upon
    the river going to Cambridge, near Icleton and Strethal. <span class="sidenote smcap">Camboritum.</span>In July, 1719,
    I discovered the <em>vestigia</em> of a Roman city here: the foundation
    of the walls is very apparent quite round, though level with the
    ground, including a space of about fifty acres: <span class="sidenote">TAB. LIX.</span>great part of it serves
    for a causeway to the public Cambridge road from London: the Crown inn
    is built upon it:<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the rest is made use of by the countrymen for
    their carriages to and fro in the fields: the earth is still high on
    both sides of it: in one part they have been long digging this wall up
    for materials in building and mending the roads: there I measured its
    breadth twelve foot, and remarked its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>composition of rag stone,
    flints and Roman brick: in a little cottage hard by, the parlour is
    paved with bricks; they are fourteen inches and an half long, and nine
    broad. In the north-west end of the city,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the people promised to
    show me a wonderful thing in the corn, which they observed every year
    with some sort of superstition. I found it to be the foundation of a
    Roman temple very apparent, it being almost harvest time: here the
    poverty of the corn growing where the walls stood, defines it to such
    a nicety, that I was able to measure it with exactness enough: the
    dimensions of the cell, or <em>naos</em>, were fifteen foot in breadth,
    forty in length; the <em>pronaos</em>, where the steps were, appeared
    at both ends, and the wall of the portico around, whereon stood the
    pillars. I remarked that the city was just a thousand Roman feet in
    breadth, and that the breadth to the length was as three to five, of
    the same proportion as they make their bricks: it is posited obliquely
    to the cardinal points, its length from north-west to south-east;
    whereby wholesomeness is so well provided for, according to the
    direction of Vitruvius. The river Cam runs under the wall, whence its
    name; for I have no scruple to think this was the <em>Camboritum</em>
    of Antoninus, meaning the ford over this river, or the crooked ford:
    in Lincolnshire we called a crooked stick, the butchers use, a
    <em>cambril</em>.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> They have found many Roman coins in the city or
    Borough field, as they call it: I saw divers of them. In this parish,
    they say, has been a royal manor: not far off, by Audlenhouse, upon
    an eminence is a great <span class="sidenote">Roman <em>camp</em>.</span>Roman camp called Ringhill; a hunting tower of
    brick now stands upon it. Beyond this the Icening-street goes toward
    Icleworth in Suffolk, <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLV.</span>parting the counties of Cambridge and Essex
    all the way; and almost parallel to it runs a great ditch, viz. from
    Royston to Balsham, called Brentditch, where it turns and goes to the
    river below Cambridge, there called Flightditch. I imagine these to
    be ancient boundaries of the Britons, and before the Roman road was
    made, which naturally enough would have served for a distinction by
    the Saxons, as at other places, had their limits lain hereabouts. Two
    miles both ways of Royston is chalky soil:<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> about Puckeridge it is
    gravelly. On Bartlow hills there is a camp too, castle camps, and Roman
    antiquities found: I am told of three remarkable barrows thereabouts,
    where bones have been dug out. At Hadstok they talk of the skin of a
    Danish king nailed upon the church-doors.</p>

  <p>Now we shall take along with us the Itinerary of Antoninus in his fifth
    journey; for after he has gone from London toward Colchester, and
    part of Suffolk, he turns into this Icening-street at <em>Icianis</em>,
    which seems to be Icesworth beyond St. Edmundsbury; from whence to
    this <em>Camboritum</em> is thirty-five miles: from thence to Huntingdon
    is just twenty-five, as they are noted; but it is to be supposed that
    the Itinerary went along the Icening-street to Royston, then took the
    Hermen-street; for so the miles exactly quadrate.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Royston.</span> Ro. <i>town</i>.</div>

  <p>Royston, as being seated upon the intersection of these two roads, no
    doubt was a Roman town<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> before Roisia<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> built her religious house
    here, and perpetuated her own name upon the Roman, which is now lost;
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>this very year they found Roman coins near there: but there seems
    to be the stump of her cross still remaining at the corner of the inn
    just where the two roads meet. The Hermen-street now coincides all the
    way with the common northern road. At Arminton, denominated from it,
    passes another branch of the river going to Cambridge in Armingford
    hundred; so by Caxton, which was probably a baiting-place: there are
    some old works without the town. A red clay begins now. Anno 1721,
    near this road my lord Oxford, digging canals at Wimpole, found many
    bodies, and pieces of iron rusty, the remains of some battle. Wimpole
    is now improved and honoured with his residence, and the noble Harleian
    library.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Durocinonte.</div>

  <p>At Godmanchester, or Gormanchester, on this side Huntingdon river,
    the name <em>chester</em> ascertains the Roman <em>castrum</em> to have
    been; nor is there any dispute of it, however critics vary about its
    name, whether <em>Durosiponte</em> or <em>Durocinonte</em>; whether there
    was a bridge, a ferry, or a ford, in most ancient times: no doubt but
    the Romans inhabited both sides of the river, and probably rather at
    Huntingdon, being a much better situation; therefore, as to antiquities
    here found, I hold myself more excusable if at present I have nothing
    to say. Mr. Camden tells us Roman coins have been frequently ploughed
    up at Gormanchester, and Henry of Huntingdon says it has been a noble
    city: but I took notice of a wooden bridge over a rivulet between the
    two towns, which ought not to be forgot, as a grateful and public
    charity, having this inscription.</p>

  <p class="clear">The Hermen-street hence becomes notorious by the name of Stangate;
    whence we may conjecture that it was originally paved with stone:
    a mile beyond Little Stukeley it turns somewhat to the right, and
    then proceeds full north and south: near Stilton some parts appear
    still paved with stone: it passes through great woods between the two
    Saltrys, where was a religious foundation of Simon Silvanect II. earl
    of Huntingdon and Northampton; among whose ruins lie buried Robert
    Brus, lord of Anandale in Scotland, and of Cleveland in England, with
    Isabel his wife, from whom the Scottish branch of our royal family is
    descended. Near the road-side Roman urns have been dug up. I thought
    it piety to turn half a mile out of the road, to visit<span class="sidenote smcap">Conington.</span> Conington, the
    seat of the noble Sir Robert Cotton, where he and the great Camden
    have often sat in council upon the antiquities of Britain, and where
    he had a choice collection of Roman inscriptions, picked up from all
    parts of the kingdom. I was concerned to see a stately old house
    of hewn stone large and handsome lie in dismal ruin, the deserted
    <em>lares</em> and the <em>genius</em> of the place fled: by it a most
    beautiful church and tower; in the windows is fine painted glass, but
    of what sort I know not: a poor cottage or two seem to be the whole
    town, once the possession of the kings of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> From those
    woods aforementioned, standing on high ground, you see all over the
    level of the fens, particularly that huge reservoir of water called
    Whitlesey-mere, full of fish, and a very pleasant place in summer
    time, where the gentry have little vessels to sail in for diversion:
    upon this hill Sir Robert Cotton, digging the foundation of a house,
    found the skeleton of a fish twelve foot long. A little to the right
    lies <span class="sidenote smcap">Ramsey.</span>Ramsey, famous for a rich abbey, where every monk lived like
    a gentleman: there is little of it left now, but a part of the old
    gate-house. <span class="sidenote">TAB. XVII.</span>In the yard I saw the neglected statue of the famous Alwyn
    the founder, called alderman of all England, cousin to king Edgar: I
    take this to be one of the most ancient pieces of English sculpture
    which we knew of: the <em>insignia</em> he has in his hand, the keys and
    ragged staff, relate to his office. Anno 1721 many pecks of Roman coins
    were found there. Probably from the name we may conjecture it was a
    Roman town. Near it is Audrey causeway: at the south end of it, in the
    parish of Willingham, a camp of a circular form, large, called Belsar’s
    hills, thought that of William the Conqueror, or his general Belasis,
    when busied in the reduction of the isle of Ely, or Odo Balistarius. A
    Roman pavement found at Ramsey.</p>

  <p>Stilton, or Stickleton, analogous to <em>Stivecle</em>, is famous for
    cheese, which they sell at 12d. per pound, and would be thought equal
    to Parmesan, were it not too near us. Beyond here the road is perfect,
    with a ridge upon the open fields, for a long way together: it goes
    pretty near north and south about Stangate; but now it takes a turn
    to the left a little, to avoid the vast fens full before our view. I
    cannot but take notice of the great stones, set at every mile from
    Grantham hither by Mr. Boulter, which he designed to have carried on
    to London. Any thing that assists or amuses travellers is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>most highly
    commendable: hence the good understanding of the ancients prompted them
    to set their funeral monuments by the road side, not crouded round
    their temples: they knew the absurdity of filling the mind with ideas
    of melancholy, at such times as they approached the sacred altars:
    there nought but what is beautiful and great ought to appear, as most
    besuiting the place where we seek the Deity. With them Mercury was
    the god of ways, and the <i lang="la">custos manium</i>. I have often wondered
    that the cheap and easy method of setting up posts with directions at
    every cross road is so little practised; which methinks deserves to be
    enforced by a law: it would teach the carpenters that make them, and
    the country people, to read, with much more emolument to the public
    than some other methods now in vogue: of other uses I need say nothing.
    All the country between Huntingdon river and Peterborough river is
    clay, sand, and gravel; but beyond that to the Humber is stone. At
    Gunwath ferry over Peterborough river is a new bridge, where boats too
    pay a toll; such is the modern way of encouraging trade and navigation.
    The people of Peterborough are ato having their river made
    navigable, out of an absurd notion that it will spoil their trade.</p>

  <p>The imperial Itinerary makes 35 miles between the last station,
    <em>Durocinonte</em>, and <em>Durobrivis</em>;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but a decimal too much
    is put into the number, for 25 is full enough: it is indeed 25 measured
    miles from Huntingdon river to the Nen at Caster: there is no dispute
    but Chesterton by Caster is the place. Dornford retains somewhat of the
    old name, where the road traversed the river by a bridge (of brass,
    the common people say.) At Chesterton on this side is a large tract
    of ground, called the Castle field, with a ditch and rampart around
    it:<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> the Roman road runs directly through it, and still retains
    its high ridge. I observe every where near the fenny country great
    precaution and strength employed; which seems owing to the incursions
    of the Britons from that part, who, no doubt, retired into these
    fastnesses as their last refuge, when the Roman arms shined all around
    them: and that reason must induce the Romans very early to think of
    draining the country, and rendering it provincial, which was the only
    means of preventing that inconvenience. The Hermen-street beyond the
    river runs for some space along the side of it upon the meadow, then
    turns up with an angle, and proceeds full north. Caster<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> is above
    half a mile from it, upon the hill. I espied a bit of the foundation of
    the wall of the Roman <em>castrum</em> in the street to the north-west
    corner of the church, under the wall of the house where the minister
    lives: it is easily known by the vast strength of the mortar, built
    of the white slab-stone of the country: this <em>castrum</em> then went
    round the church-yard, and took in the whole top of the hill, facing
    the mid day sun. Underneath it lay the city; for below the church-yard
    the ground is full of foundations and Mosaics: I saw a bit of a
    pavement in the cellar of the ale-house (the Boot.)</p>

    the ploughed fields between the town and the river, toward Ford-green,
    they are often found, with earthen pipes, bricks, and all sorts of
    antiquities: in that field is a tract running quite through, whereon
    corn grows very poorly, which is nothing but a street or road laid
    with a deep bed of gravel: the vulgar have a foolish story about it,
    as at other places, and say that lady Kyneburg cursed it; by whom
    they mean the abbess that built a religious house here, which stood
    eastward of the church: some part of it is still left. This meadow is
    called Norman-gate field, or more properly Dorman-gate, some corrupted
    memorial of the ancient name of the town, which extended itself hither;
    and foundations are found all about here, and innumerable coins, which
    they call Dorman pence: part of this is Berrysted, where antiquities
    are dug up every day. Higher up toward Peterborough is Mill-field:
    Mosaic pavements are there dug up, and other things; and seems to have
    been a little citadel belonging to the town. Part of the church is of
    an ancient fabric, but new modelled: there is a curious inscription
    upon a stone over the choir door thus: (the letters are raised.)</p>

  <p class="noindent">it is wrong transcribed in Camden. The steeple stands in the middle
    of the church: the tower is a fine piece of ancient architecture with
    semi-circular arches; I judge the spire of later date. The square well
    by the porch no doubt is Roman; it is curbed with hewn stone: though
    it stands on a hill, yet the water is very high: at the east end of
    the church is a very old cross. Mr. Morton is very copious upon this
    station, in his curious history of Northamptonshire; the inquisitive
    reader will consult him: I only recite such things as I saw, and fear
    being tedious upon such places as admit of no doubt among antiquaries.
    A little higher up the river, near <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>Wansford bridge,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a gold British
    coin was found, in the possession of Mr. Maurice Johnson, J. C. Anno
    1720, at Thorp, the seat of Sir Francis St. John, by Peterborough, a
    Mosaic pavement was found: this was undoubtedly a villa of some great
    Roman. In the garden here are some fine antique statues of marble,
    but suffering more from the weather, in this moist situation, than
    from age: in the middle is a Livia of coloss proportion, the wife
    of Augustus: in the four quarters are Diana, Amphion, an orator, a
    gladiator: upon the terrace, an admirable Hercules killing Hydra: in
    the court are two equestrian figures in copper, Henry IV. of France,
    and Don John of Austria: within the house over most of the doors are
    placed busts, Bassianus, Caracalla, &amp;c. these antiquities were of the
    Arundel collection.</p>

  <p>Hence I travelled upon the Roman road all the way to Stanford. As it
    rises from the water-side of Peterborough river, and passes over the
    corn-fields, it appears in a lofty ridge called Norman-gate, i. e.
    Dorman-gate; only here and there they have dug great holes in it for
    its materials: it goes forwards to Lolham bridges, by the name of
    Long-ditch, which we treated of before, being its oldest and directest
    road, full north and south. In the reign of Nero all the southern
    part of the island was conquered, and the <em>Brigantes</em> were fast
    friends; so that in his time we may conclude the Hermen-street was made
    as far as Sleford by Catus Decianus the procurator, as we suggested in
    the first letter. But now our journey is by the left-hand new branch,
    and which goes out of the other with an angle in the parish of Upton,
    called the Forty-foot way: almost at Southorp, it is inclosed in a
    pasture; but beyond that you find it again, going by Walcot inclosures,
    then through Bernack fields, winding a little to the left hand till
    it enters Burleigh park: its true line from Walcot corner would pass
    through Tolethorp wood, but the river below Stanford was too broad; so
    it passes through Burleigh park, where its gravel is transferred to
    make walks in the gardens: at Wothorp park-wall it appears again with a
    very high ridge and agreeable sight, descending the valley to Stanford
    river, which it passes a little above the town between it and Tynwell;
    then rises again upon the opposite hill, entering Lincolnshire, with
    its broad and elated crest, till it goes to Brigcasterton: it is
    composed all the way of stone, gravel, and hard materials, got near at
    hand: the common road leaves it intirely from Peterborough river to
    Brigcasterton, crossing it at Wothrop park-wall.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

  <p>Brigcasterton happened most convenient for a station, being ten miles
    from the last, or Durobrivis; but the Itinerary mentions not its name;
    for the distances between them, and likewise to Lincoln, impugn Mr.
    Camden and such as place Causennis here: however, it was fenced about
    with a deep mote on two sides, the river supplying its use on the other
    two; for it stands in an angle, and the Romans made a little curve
    in the road here on purpose to take it in, as it offered itself so
    conveniently, then rectified the obliquity on the other side of the
    town: it consists of one street running through its length upon the
    road: this great ditch and banks are called the Dikes. I saw many coins
    that are found here; and one pasture is called Castle-close at the
    corner: they say the foundation of a wall was dug up there.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

    the Hermen-street accompanying. This village is at present under the
    hill where the road goes near the spring of the Witham, to which I
    suppose its name alludes, as the present to <em>pant avon</em>: both
    signify the valley of the river in British: perhaps the most ancient
    name of the river was <em>Cavata</em>; whence that part of the country
    that is watered by it assumed the name of Kestevon,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> importing the
    river Cavata, <em>Cavaut avon</em>; as Lindsey from <em>Lindum</em>: the
    present name Witham, or <em>Guithavon</em>, signifying the separating
    river, as it principally divides these two. Many Roman coins are found

  <p>The Hermen-street, now called High-dike road, goes along the heath,
    which preserves it from being worn away; and it is a sight highly
    entertaining.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> The next town it comes to is Ancaster:<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> what was its
    Roman name I know not; but it has been a very strong city, intrenched
    and walled about; as may be seen very plainly for the most part, and
    perceived by those that are the least versed in these searches. The
    bowling-green behind the Red-lion inn is made in the ditch: when they
    were levelling it, they came to the old foundation. At this end of the
    town, where a dove-cote stands, is Castle close, full of foundations
    appearing every where above ground: the ditch and rampire encompass
    it. Here are prodigious quantities of Roman coins found; many people
    in the town have traded in the sale of them these thirty years: they
    are found too in great plenty upon all the hills round the town,
    especially southward, and toward Castle-pits; so that one may well
    persuade one’s self, that glorious people sowed them in the earth like
    corn, as a certain harvest of their fame, and indubitable evidence of
    their presence at this place. After a shower of rain the school-boys
    and shepherds look for them on the declivities, and never return empty.
    I saw an <em>Antoninus Pius</em>, of base silver, found that morning I
    was there: likewise I saw many of Faustina, Verus, Commodus, Gallienus,
    Salonina, Julia Mæsa, Constantius Chlorus, Helena, Maximiana Theodora,
    Constantine the Great, Magnentius, Constans, Tetricus, Victorinus,
    &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The town consists of one street running north and south along
    the road: there is a spring at both ends of the town, and which, no
    doubt, was the reason of their pitching it at this place; for no more
    water is met with from hence to Lincoln. There is a road on the west
    side of the town, which was for the convenience of those that travelled
    when the gates were shut. On a stone laid upon the church wall I read
    this inscription, in large letters of lead melted into the cavities.</p>

    and W. Harrison, in his description of Britain, II. 17. mentions Mosaic
    pavements.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The road seems to bend somewhat in this part, which I

  <div class="sidenote">Ro. <i>camp</i>.</div>

  <p>A mile and half off to the west, in the parish of Hunnington, upon
    a hill surveying a lovely prospect, both toward the sea-coast, and
    into Nottinghamshire, is a summer camp of the Romans, or a <i lang="la">castrum
    exploratorum</i>, of a square form and doubly trenched, but of no great
    bulk: the entrance seems to have been on the east side. Not long ago,
    in this place, have been dug up, in ploughing, bits of spears, bridles
    and swords, and two urns full of coins: I saw a large brass one of
    Agrippa, and Julia daughter to Augustus, with many more, in possession
    of the Rev. Mr. Garnon of North Witham: his daughter gave me a score of
    them at Newark, Dec. 1728. Mr. Banks, 1735, digging for his new house
    at Ancaster, found much Roman antiquity.</p>

  <p>All the way from this road, upon Ancaster heath, we have a view of
    the sea, and the towering height of Boston steeple. A little further
    we come to a place, of no mean note among the country people, called
    Byard’s Leap, where the Newark road crosses the Roman: here is a
    cross of stone, and by it four little holes made in the ground: they
    tell silly stories of a witch and a horse making a prodigious leap,
    and that his feet rested in these holes, which I rather think the
    boundaries of four parishes: perhaps I may be too fanciful in supposing
    this name a corruption of <i lang="la">vialis lapis</i>. I mentioned before,
    that here I apprehended the Roman road from the fen country passed
    down the hill toward <em>Crocolana</em>. Upon our road there are many
    stones placed; but most seem modern, and like stumps of crosses, yet
    probably are mile-stones: it would be of little use to measure the
    intervals; for one would find that the whole distance between two towns
    was equally divided by such a number of paces as came nearest the
    total. Over-against Temple-Bruer is a cross upon a stone, cut through
    in the shape of that borne by the knights Templars, and I suppose a
    boundary of their demesnes: some part of their old church is left, of a
    circular form as usual. <em>Bruer</em> in this place signifies a heath.
    The Hermen-street hereabout is very bold and perfect, made of stone
    gathered all along from the superficial quarries, the holes remaining.
    I observed, whenever it intercepts a valley of any considerable
    breadth, whose water must necessarily drain past it, there is an
    intermission left in the road; for otherwise their work would be vain:
    and the ends of the road are flaunted off neatly for that purpose,
    laying perhaps a small quantity of solid materials to vindicate the
    track, and not hinder the voidance of the rain: it goes perfectly
    strait from Ancaster to Lincoln full north, butting upon the west side
    of Lincoln town. A <em>tumulus</em> some time upon the centre of it: it
    is notorious from hence that the intent of these roads was chiefly
    to mark out the way to such places in the march of their armies; for
    there can be no need of a causeway for travellers, the heath being
    so perfectly good; and that our English word <em>highway</em> is hence
    derived, and applied to public ways. When we come to the towns upon the
    cliff side, they have ploughed up this barren ground on both sides the
    road, and basely lowered it for miles together, by dragging the plough
    a-cross it at every furrow; so that every year levels it some inches,
    and, was it not a public road, it would soon be quite obliterated.
    Here are six villages on the left hand, at a mile distance each, and a
    little off the road, which make an agreeable prospect. Just descending
    Lincoln hill, I saw the true profile of the road broke off by the
    wearing away of the ground: it is about thirty foot broad, made of
    stone piled up into an easy convexity: there is likewise generally a
    little trench dug in the natural earth along both sides of the road,
    which is of great use in conducting the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> that falls from the
    heavens into the vallies upon the long side of the road both ways, and
    prevents its lodging and stagnating against the side of their work: the
    turf that came out of those trenches they threw upon the road to cover
    it with grass: thus had they all the curious and convenient ways for
    beauty, use, and perpetuity.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

  <p>Below the hill the Hermen-street meets with the Foss, which now united
    march directly up to the city, across a great vale where the river
    Witham runs, by Mr. Baxter thought the <em>Victius</em> of Ravennas: Mr.
    Leland calls it <em>Lindis</em>. As it descends towards Boston, it is
    besieged, as it were, by religious houses, planted at every mile; such
    as Nocton priory, founded by Robert D’arci, lord of the place, 1164.
    now the elegant seat of Sir William Ellys, bart. Kyme priory, founded
    by Philip and Simon de Kyme, knts. to which the Tailboyses added, who
    married the heiress; Barlings abbey, founded by Ralph de Hay, and his
    brother Richard; Stanfield, the seat now of Sir John Tyrwhit, bart.
    Bardney abbey built by king Ethelred, who was buried here anno 712.
    much added by Remigius bishop of Lincoln; Tupholm, founded by Rob. de
    Novavilla; Stikeswold priory of the Benedictine nuns; <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXVIII.</span>Kirksted abbey,
    by Hugh de Breton, whose ichnography is discoverable from its ruins;
    Revesby abbey, by William de Romara.</p>

  <p>I think it not worth while, in a Roman journey, to dwell upon these
    places, and haste up hill to Lincoln,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> a great and most famous city
    of theirs, graced with the title and privilege of a<span class="sidenote smcap">Lindum.</span> colony; therefore
    called <i lang="la">Lindum colonia</i>; a bold and noble situation upon a <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXVIII.</span>high
    hill, which we may think no less than five cities united into one; of
    all which I shall give a short account in their order, as to what I
    observed, without transcribing such matters as the reader will find
    better delivered in authors. My business is to illustrate the <a href="#i_088_2">88th
    Plate</a>, which I made by pacing as I walked about the city, intended to
    give the idea of the place as formed originally by the Romans, and of
    their roads leading to and from it. <span class="sidenote">1.</span>Below the hill, and westward of
    the city, the river throws itself into a great pool, called Swan pool
    from the multitude of swans upon it. All around this place the ground
    is moory, and full of bogs and islets, called now Carham, which means
    a dwelling upon the <em>car</em>, that is, the fen. Now here, without
    question, was the British city in the most early times, where they
    drove their cattle backwards and forwards, and retired themselves into
    its inaccessible securities; and from thence I apprehend the name
    of <em>caer</em>, signifying a fortification or inclosure in all the
    most ancient languages, came in this country to be retained in these
    morasses: this was its name as a dwelling, or a collection of native
    inhabitants; but the pool in their language was called <em>lhyn</em>,
    and that denominated the Roman city <em>Lindum</em>, being the hill
    hanging over this pool. From this Carham you have a pleasant view of
    the west front of the cathedral. The shape of the pool is thought very
    much to resemble a <span class="sidenote">2.</span>map of England, when you survey it from the top of
    the cathedral. The Romans, pleased with this notable eminence, placed
    their city upon it, which they first built in the form of a large
    square, the southern wall standing upon the precipice or edge of the
    hill, and wanted no other external fence: quite round the other three
    sides they carried a deep trench too, which still remains, except on
    the south-east angle. This city was divided into four equal parts, by
    two cross streets that cut it quite through upon the cardinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
    points: the two southern quarters were taken up, one by the castle,
    the other by the church which Remigius built; but, when Alexander the
    bishop projected a structure of much larger dimensions, they carried
    the sacred inclosure beyond the eastern bounds of the city, and so
    built a new wall farther that way, as it is now, with battlements
    and towers. The north and south Roman gates of this part of the city
    remain; the one intire, the other pulled down about fifteen years ago
    by Mr. Houghton: the northern, called Newport gate,<span class="sidenote">TAB. LIV</span> is the noblest
    remnant of this sort in Britain, as far as I know. Upon the first sight
    of it I was struck with admiration, as well of its noble simplicity,
    as that hitherto it should not have been taken notice of: it is a vast
    semicircle of stones of very large dimensions, and, by what I could
    perceive, laid without mortar, connected only by their cuniform shape.
    This magnificent arch is sixteen foot diameter, the stones four foot
    thick at bottom: from the injuries of time, but worse of hands, it
    is somewhat luxated, yet seems to have a joint in the middle, not a
    key-stone: on both sides, towards the upper part, are laid horizontal
    stones of great dimensions, some ten or twelve foot long, to take off
    the side pressure, very judiciously adapted. This arch rises from
    an impost of large mouldings, some part of which, especially on the
    left-hand side, are still discoverable: below on both sides was a
    postern, or foot passage, made of like stones; but against that on the
    left side is a house built, and when I went down into the cellar I
    found a chimney set before it. The ground here in the street has been
    very much raised, and the top of the wall is of a later workmanship:
    it is indeed a most venerable piece of antiquity, and what a lover of
    architecture would be hugely delighted withall. They that look upon
    a gate among the vestiges of the <em>forum</em> of Nerva at Rome, will
    think they see the counterpart of this; but, of the two, this has the
    most grandeur in aspect: the drawing supplies any further harangue
    about it. From this gate eastward, some part of the old Roman wall
    is to be seen by a pasture, made of stone and very strong mortar:
    thereabout too are some arches under ground. The west gate toward the
    gallows was pulled down, not beyond memory: that on the south side,
    which I spoke of, still shows one jamb from between the houses, and
    two or three stones of the same make as the former, just above the
    springing of the arch: if you go up stairs in the adjoining house
    within the city, you may see the postern on the east side, which is big
    enough for a bed to stand in. I doubt not but there is, or was, another
    answerable on the other side; but this street is much contracted from
    its original breadth by the subsequent populousness of the place; and
    the ground here, being upon the edge of the hill, is much worn down,
    as the first is heaped up, from the condition of former ages. But by
    Newport gate before described, is another large and curious remnant of
    Roman workmanship: this is called the Mint wall, and stands in a garden
    in the north-west quarter of the city: it is still sixteen foot high,
    above forty foot long, and turned again with an angle: on the left-hand
    side behind it are houses built and marks of arches. What it was
    originally cannot now be affirmed; the composition of it is thus: upon
    squared stone of the common sort, but a little decayed through age, is
    laid a triple course of Roman brick, which rises one foot in height;
    the bricks seem to be a Roman foot long, and our seven inches broad:
    above this three courses of stone, which rise about a foot more; then
    three layers of brick, as before; upon that twelve courses of stone,
    then brick and stone to the top: the scaffold-holes are left all the
    way: the mortar is very hard, and full of little pebbles.</p>

  <p>But this city being happily seated for navigation of the river, and the
    chief thoroughfare to the north, soon increased to that degree, that
    the Romans were obliged to add another to it as big as the former: this
    they did southward upon the declivity of the hill, and so tallied it to
    the other, that the new side-walls answered in a parallel to the old,
    and the most southern lay upon the river. Eastward the ditch without
    is turned into a broad street called the Beast-market, and there below
    Claskgate a great part of the old Roman wall is left, made of stones
    piled sideways, first with one direction, then with another, as was
    a common method with them: one piece of it is now eighty foot long,
    eighteen high; a little bit of it lower down is twelve foot long, as
    much high: between that gate upwards and the old city-wall, by the
    Greestone stairs, is the old ditch to be seen, much talked of, but not
    understood: it is called Weredyke. The people have a notion that the
    river came up here, and that these stairs were a landing-place from
    the water-side, and denominated from I know not what Grecian traders:
    but this is utterly impossible in nature. To the west the ditch and
    foundation of the wall is still left, though many times repaired and
    demolished in the frequent sieges this town has sustained, especially
    in the wars of Maud the empress: at the bottom of it, towards the
    water, is a round tower called Lucy tower, and famous in her history.
    This then was the state of this place in Roman times: the Foss and
    Hermen-street entered the city at Stanbow, or the stoney arch; there
    they parted: the Hermen-street went directly up the hill, and so full
    north through Newport; the Foss, according to its natural direction,
    ascended it obliquely on the eastern side without the ancient city, and
    so proceeded to the sea coast north-east.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">4.</div>

  <p>But still here were two more great additions to the length of this
    city, and which stretched it out to an enormous bulk; the first
    northwards above the hill: it is called Newport, or the new city,
    500 paces long. This I apprehend to have been done in the reign of
    the Saxon kings: it lies on both sides the Hermen-street, and was
    fenced with a wall and ditch hewn out of the rock: at the two farther
    corners were round towers and a gate, the foundations of which remain:
    there were several churches and religious houses in this place; and
    I suppose it was chiefly inhabited by Jews, who had settled here in
    great numbers, and grown rich by trade: there is a well still called
    Grantham’s well, from a child they ludicrously crucified and threw into
    that well.</p>

  <p><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>After the Norman conquest, when a great part of the
    first city was turned into a castle, I apprehend they added the last
    intake southward in the angle of the Witham, and made a new cut, called
    Sinsil dike, on the south and east side, for its security. The city
    then being of this huge compass, gave occasion for that prophecy, as
    they call it, and fancy to have been fulfilled in the year 1666:</p>

    old writers; and to this day a part of <em>swan</em> pool is called
    <em>nichol</em> pool: in some places of Lincolnshire the vulgar pronounce
    <em>little</em>, <em>nickle</em>, and some other words of that sort. Though
    this place is much declined since those times, yet of late it begins
    to flourish again very considerably. The meaning of <em>grecian</em>

    (<em>grees</em>) as they appear <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>at this day, a commodious descent from

  <p><a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>In this last part of the city, on both
  sides the Roman road, were many funeral monuments of the old Romans;
  some of which they now dig up, and doubtless much more when they first
  built upon this ground. I saw a pit where they found a stone with an
  inscription, this summer: through age and the workmen’s tools it was
  defaced, only small remains of D. M. &amp; VIX. ANN. XXX. such letters as
  showed its intent, with carvings of palm-trees, and other things: this
  is behind the house where the lord Hussey was beheaded for rebellion in
  the time of Henry VIII. the great bow window through which he came upon
  the scaffold was taken down this year: it stands over-against another
  stone building, of an ancient model, said to be the palace of John
  of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, who lived here in royal state, and had
  the privilege of coining: his arms are here carved in stone. Upon the
  steeple of St. Mary’s church they have placed in the wall an ancient
  monumental stone, with this imperfect inscription:</p>

  <p class="noindent">There is another obscure inscription upon the upper part of the stone,
    but has been added since, and is christian. Upon the church-wall lies
    an old stone by the conduit, which Leland takes notice of, and says is
    Ranulf de Kyme. Immense are the Roman antiquities dug up about this
    famous colony: nor has the perpetual turning up the ground exhausted
    them. The late Dr. Primrose had a great collection: I remember to have
    seen a fine glass urn in his possession, now with Martin Folkes, esq;
    found near Newport gate; also a very large silver seal of one of the
    Quincys earls of Lincoln, now with Nevil King, esq. Wm. Pownal, esq;
    has many coins very well preserved, particularly a Carausus with his
    wife on the same coin, which is a great rarity. I am in hopes he will
    some time favour the learned with an accurate account of this place,
    as it highly deserves. Upon the Roman road eastward are some barrows:
    many urns, and the like, have been dug up about them, especially near
    the stone pits, with earthen aqueducts, and all kinds of antiquities.
    Mr. Pownal showed me a brass <em>armilla</em>, found with a corpse
    which possibly was British.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Upon the road going to Staynton, is
    an hospital of St. Giles, built by Remigius; and behind it are great
    cavities in the rock under ground, which people fancied to be Roman
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>catacombs, and affirmed they had seen earthen and brazen pots,
    inscriptions and the like, with many other strange stories: to search
    this matter thoroughly, provided with torches, we traced them to the
    utmost corners, but found them only quarries. Let us now survey the
    cathedral. It is far more magnificent than any I have yet seen: there
    are two great gate-houses or entrances to it from the west: the lower
    part of the front, and of the two towers, are of Remigius his building,
    as is easily discoverable by the colour of the stones, and by the
    manner of architecture: but Alexander built the additions upon it, the
    body of the cathedral, the choir and St. Mary’s tower, which once had a
    very lofty spire upon it; a prodigious work for a single man, and that
    not the only one, as appears by what we have mentioned of him. St. Hugh
    the Burgundian built the east end, or<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXIX.</span> St. Mary’s chapel, where he had a
    shrine; and the chapter-house cieled with a beautiful stone roof, one
    pillar in the middle. The cloysters and the library are fine: here are
    many books and manuscripts, and an old leaden inscription of William
    d’Agincourt, cousin to Remigius, already printed. Here are many bells,
    particularly one remarkably large, called <em>Tom of Lincoln</em>, which
    takes up a whole steeple to itself; probably consecrated to that great
    champion of the church, St. Thomas of Canterbury, the first cathedral
    mentioned in Bede; I suppose an humble building, and contained within
    the ancient walls. Two Catharine-wheel windows, as called, at the ends
    of the larger transepts, are remarkably fine for mullion-work and
    painted glass. Here are great numbers of ancient brasses and monuments:
    one I have engraven from a drawing procured by Browne Willys, esq;
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. XVI.</span>Tab. 16. the stone only is left near the west door. To set down the
    particularities of the church would require a volume. South of it, upon
    the very brow of the hill, is the bishop’s palace, built by Robert
    de Chesney, who gave two great bells likewise: bishop Bek and other
    successors enlarged it to a magnificence equal with the cathedral: it
    stands just south of the Roman wall; a very expensive work, for the
    foundations of it reach, as it were, below hill: over this hung many
    large bow windows of curious workmanship, looking over the tops of the
    lower city into Nottinghamshire: the kitchen had seven chimneys in it:
    the hall was stately: the gate-house remains intire, with coats of arms
    of the founders. This palace was ruined in the time of the civil wars:
    good part of it might be handsomely rebuilt without an extravagant expence.</p>

  <p>In Leland’s time one of the stone crosses of queen Eleanor was here
    standing in the market place: it were endless to enumerate the
    religious houses, gates, and old buildings, that croud up every part
    of the streets. Here were originally fifty two churches. I never saw
    such a fund of antique speculations in any town in England: I heard
    continually of coins and urns found all the country over, as at
    Cathorp, Methringham, Nocton, &amp;c. I found this inscription on a stone
    in the stable wall of the Rein-deer inn.</p>

  <p class="noindent antiqua">+RANDOLF: DE: BORTON: GYT: ICY: DEUI: DE: SA: ALME: AYT: MERCY: AMEN.</p>

  <p class="noindent">This castle of William the Conqueror’s is a large place, and
    exceedingly strong with walls, ditches, keep, and towers: over against
    it westward is an intrenchment made by king Stephen.</p>

  <p>Through the whole length of Lincolnshire, from north to south, in
    a strait line runs a ledge of hills, that is, from Stanford to
    Winteringham: the Romans, observing this, carried their road upon
    it, and left the original stem of Fokingham. This high ground is
    similar all along, having a steep descent westward, overlooking
    Nottinghamshire, and is a rock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> rag-stone quite through; the
    stone is white, and rises in <em>strata</em>, thicker as deeper: the
    surface is heathy. The river Witham, which rises on the west of this
    ridge, must have run into the Humber, had not Nature, by her propensity
    of drawing it eastward, as her declivities generally run, broke it off
    in the middle by that great valley under Lincoln, and made a passage
    for it into the estuary. Hence it is that the stone upon this western
    cliff is full of sea-shells; for, when the great and universal deluge
    had carried those inhabitants of the ocean into the mediterranean
    parts, by the weight of their shells they were unapt to retire again
    along with the waters, so were intercepted against this cliff, and
    received into the nascent stone.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> A remarkable antediluvian
    curiosity I procured for the repository of the Royal Society, from
    these parts; being the real skeleton of a crocodile, or some such
    animal, inclosed in a broad flat stone. But now it is time to proceed.</p>

  <p>The Hermen-street going northward from Lincoln is scarce diminished,
    because its materials are hard stone, and the heath on both sides
    favours it: three miles off, near a watering-place, a branch divides
    from it with an obtuse angle to the left, which goes towards Yorkshire.
    We suppose the Romans at first had an erroneous idea of the island of
    Britain, and thought its northern parts in a more easterly longitude
    than by experience they found; and thus in Ptolemy’s maps the length
    of Scotland is represented running out enormously that way: but when
    Agricola, in his conquests northward, had discovered that mistake,
    and that the passage over the Humber was very incommodious for the
    march of soldiers, he struck out this new road, as another branch of
    the Hermen-street, by way of Doncaster, from thence observing its
    natural direction northward. When we turn ourselves here, and look
    back to Lincoln, we see the road butts upon the western spires of the
    cathedral: and when from thence you survey the road, it is an agreeable
    prospect; your eye being in the middle line of its whole length to the
    horizon. I had a mind to pursue this branch through Lincolnshire as far
    as the first station, <em>Agelocum</em>: this ridge is likely to be of
    an eternal duration, as wholly out of all roads: it proceeds directly
    over the heath, then descends the cliff through the rich country at
    bottom, between two hedge-rows, by the name of Tilbridge lane. When you
    view it on the brink of the hill, it is as a visto or avenue running
    through a wood or garden very strait, and pleasanter in prospect than
    when you come to travel it; wanting a Roman legion to repair it. You
    pass through Stretton and Gate-Burton, so called from the road, and by
    a ferry cross over the Trent, which lands you at</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Agelocum.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXVII.</div>

  <p>Littleborough, <em>Agelocum</em>, or, as by later times corrupted, with
    a <em>sibilus</em>, into <em>Segelocum</em>.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This is a small village
    three miles above Ganesborough, just upon the edge of the water,
    and in an angle. <em>Agel auk</em>, <em>frons aquæ</em>, is a pertinent
    etymology: it seems only to have been environed with a ditch, and of a
    square form, and the water ran quite round it; for to the west, where
    White’s bridge is, a watery valley hems it in: so that it was a place
    sufficiently strong. The church stands upon the highest ground. The
    Trent has washed away part of the eastern side of the town. Foundations
    and pavements are visible in the bank. Mr. Roger Gale, passing by,
    once found an urn there, with a coin of Domitian’s: great numbers of
    coins have been taken up in ploughing and digging: they called them
    swine-pennies, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>because those creatures sometimes root them up, and
    the inhabitants take little care to save them. I saw a few there: the
    reverend Mr. Ella, vicar of Rampton hard by, has collected several, and
    some valuable, such as the following, of which he sent me an account.</p>

    a shield, a spear in her left hand, a laurel in her right, the right
    foot upon a rock BRITANNIA SC.</p>

  <p>CONSTANTINVS AVG. ℞ SOLI INVICTO COMITI. Another, ℞ ALEMANNIA DEVICTA.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Several of those struck about Constantius’s time with a galeate head
    on one side, and URBS ROMA ℞ a wolf suckling Romulus and Remus:
    others, CONSTANTINOPOLIS: many more, of Aurelius, Faustina, Gallienus,
    Tetricus, Victorinus, Carausius, Constantine, Constantius, Crispus,
    Allectus, and the lower Empire. About forty years ago, when the
    inclosures between the town and bridge were ploughed up, abundance of
    these coins were found, many intaglias of agate, cornelian, the finest
    coral-coloured urns and patera’s, some wrought in <em>basso relievo</em>,
    the workman’s name generally impressed on the inside of the bottom: a
    <em>discus</em> with an emperor’s head embossed. In 1718, they dug up
    two altars, handsomely moulded, which are set as piers in a wall on
    the side of the steps that lead from the water-side to the inn: on one
    is the remnant of an inscription, LIS ARAM DD. these are of the course
    grit-stone. Many very little coins are found here, like flatted pease;
    they call them mites. Mr. Hardy has a large urn with the face of a
    woman on the out-side. In this same field near White’s bridge are great
    foundations of building: coins are often found too at the lowest edge
    of the water, when the tide is gone off, and in dry seasons. On the
    east side of the river has been a camp. Returning by Tilbridge lane,
    upon the top of the heath is a spring, which they say flows and abates
    with the tide in the Trent, though five miles off: the like is reported
    of divers others hereabouts.</p>

  <p>From the place where the roads branch out, before spoken of, I
    proceeded on the Hermen-street, northward, to Spittle on the street.
    There are milliary stones set upon the road all the way: it is very
    delightful riding, being wholly champaign, or heath. Of these stones I
    believe some are Roman, others later crosses, perhaps to supply their
    place: some <em>tumuli</em> scattered here and there. This place no doubt
    was a mansion, because a little beck runs through it, arising hard by:
    and it is ten miles from Lincoln; a convenient distance. I took the
    bearing of the road just north and south. Here is an hospital, said to
    be founded 1308, and great foundations all around, some of which are
    probably Roman. At present the village consists of two farm-houses, a
    chapel, an inn, and a sessions-house: three or four <em>tumuli</em> near
    the town. Upon the chapel is a silly Latin inscription:</p>

    whole country is a quarry just beneath the surface. Beyond Spittle
    woodland begins: by Broughton, a vein of deep sand well planted with
    coneys. At all these towns upon the Roman road, coins and antiquities
    are found; Hibberstow, Gainsthorp, Broughton, Roxby, &amp;c. at Sandton
    has been a Roman pottery: between Scalby and Manton is a Roman camp:
    in Appleby is a place called Julian’s Bower: at Kirton, John of Gaunt
    had a seat: twenty-nine towns round about held of him in socage. I take
    Broughton to be another station, because of its name, and that a brook
    runs through it; so that the interval between Lincoln and Wintringham
    is conveniently divided into three parts, ten miles each, by Spittle
    and Broughton, the whole being thirty Roman miles. Thornholm, a mitred
    priory: there is but another in England, Spalding. Risby and Gokewell,
    two nunneries; some small remains of both. To the left is Normanby,
    where the late duke of Buckingham was born, and whence his title.</p>

  <p>We kept the road all the way, though sometimes it passes over little
    bogs, and at last about Winterton is inclosed: it terminates in some
    arable, where it is well nigh lost a mile south of <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Wintringham</span> Ro. <i>town</i>.</span>Wintringham.
    Upon a rising ground at the end of the Roman road, a little to the
    right, and half a mile east of the present Wintringham, stood the old
    Roman town, of which they have a perfect knowledge, and ploughed up
    great foundations within memory: <span class="sidenote">TAB. [i XVI]. 2d Vol.</span>it is now a common, skirted by the
    marshes upon the Humber: the soil hereabouts is clay. This site of Old
    Wintringham, as called, was almost inclosed with water in its first
    condition, having only a slip of land towards the Roman road as an
    entrance: the valley westward between it and the town is now called
    the Old Haven, where three elm-trees stand: the east is bounded by the
    mouth of the Ankham, which I suppose is <em>ang</em> in British, broad,
    <em>avon</em>, river, from its broad marshes. The city was ploughed
    up six years ago, and great numbers of antiquities found, now lost;
    great pavements, chimney-stones, &amp;c. often breaking their ploughs:
    in several places they found streets made of sea-sand and gravel. It
    is a <em>peninsula</em> between the Humber and Ankham, and had most
    opportunely a fine spring on the east side, which no doubt was embraced
    by the Romans: it is likewise a great rarity in nature, arising so
    near the sea in a clayey marsh: there is stone-work left round it, and
    an iron ladle to drink at, which is done frequently by travellers,
    as with a religious necessity. Several intakes have been made beyond
    this city in memory of man, which drives the Humber farther off, and
    increases the marsh: it is half a mile between it and old town. The old
    haven-mouth is called Flashmire. This place is over-against Brough,
    the Roman town on the Yorkshire shore; but it is rather more eastward:
    so that with the tide coming in they ferried over very commodiously
    thither, and even now they are forced to take the tide. <em>Buck-bean
    trefoil</em> grows upon all the bogs hereabouts. The bearing of the end
    of the Roman way is precisely north and south, as at Lincoln; so that
    it is a true meridian line from the west end of the cathedral. The
    present Wintringham is a dirty poor place, but still a corporation;
    and the mayor is chosen only out of one street, next the old town,
    where was a chapel: the bell of it now hangs in a wooden frame by the
    pillory, and makes a most ridiculous appearance. Here is still a ferry
    from a small creek kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> open by some freshes; it was ill judged of
    travellers to desert the old Roman way and ferry, and turn the road to
    Barton, (where the Humber is much broader and very dangerous) for no
    other reason but because it is somewhat nearer and over-against Hull:
    but the saving three miles riding does not compensate for the time or
    hazard of so uncouth a passage. I am persuaded the old name of this
    station was <em>Abontrus</em>, the same as the name of the river, whence
    they have formed the mimic Wintringham. Here is a vast jaw-bone or rib
    of a whale, that has lain time out of mind, like that at St. James’s.
    Wintringham church stands on the end of the Lincolnshire <em>Alpes</em>.
    Well may the Humber take its name from the noise it makes: my landlord,
    who is a sailor, says in a high wind it is incredibly great and
    terrible, like the crash and dashing together of ships. The Roman way
    beyond the Humber at Brough is continued in Yorkshire; but of its
    progress that way I can say nothing at present, this being the northern
    boundary of my expeditions.</p>

  <p>From the termination of the Hermen-street, just by the knoll of old
    Wintringham, and the hedge on the side of a common, a lesser vicinal
    branch of a Roman road goes directly west to Aukborough, passing over
    Whitton brook. All the ground hereabouts terminates at the Humber in
    longitudinal ridges going north and south, and all steep like a cliff
    to the west, plain and level eastward. Aukborough I visited, because
    I suspected it the <span class="sidenote smcap">Aquis.</span><i>Aquis</i> of the Romans, in Ravennas, and I was
    not deceived; for I presently descried the Roman <em>castrum</em>.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. XVII. 2d Vol.</span>There are two little <em>tumuli</em> upon the end of the road entering
    the town. The Roman castle is square, three hundred foot each side, the
    entrance north: the west side is objected to the steep cliff hanging
    over the Trent, which here falls into the Humber; for this castle is
    very conveniently placed in the north-west angle of Lincolnshire, as a
    watch-tower over all Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire, which it surveys.
    Hence you see the Ouse coming from York, and downward the Humber mouth,
    and all over the isle of Axholm. Much salt-marsh is gained from all
    these rivers, though now and then they reclaim and alter their course.
    Then they discover the subterraneous trees lodged here at the Deluge
    in great abundance, along the banks of all the three rivers: the wood
    is hard and black, and sinks like a stone. Here are likewise other
    plentiful reliques of the Deluge in the stones, viz. sea-shells of all
    sorts, where a <em>virtuoso</em> might furnish his cabinet: sometimes a
    stone is full of one sort of shell, sometimes of another; sometimes,
    of little globules like the spawn of fishes: I viewed them with great
    pleasure. I am told the camp is now called Countess Close, and they
    say a countess of Warwick lived there; perhaps owned the estate;<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
    but there are no marks of building, nor I believe ever were. The
    <em>vallum</em> and ditch are very perfect: before the north entrance is
    a square plot called the Green, where I suppose the Roman soldiers lay
    <em>pro castris</em>: in it is a round work, formed into a labyrinth,
    which they call Julian’s Bower. The church is of good stone, has a
    square tower, but the choir ruinous, excluded by a wooden partition:
    between it and the way to the marshes, a good spring rising out of the
    cliff. I dare say no antiquary ever visited this place since the Romans
    left it; for the people were perfectly ignorant of any matters we could
    inquire about; and as to finding coins, &amp;c. they would make us no other
    answer than laughing at us: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>but I heard since, from other good
    hands, that they have been found here in great numbers.</p>

  <p>Because I have frequently found these places called <em>Julian’s
    Bower</em>, both at Roman towns and others, but especially very common
    in Lincolnshire, I considered what should be the meaning of them, and
    shall here give my thoughts about it. They are generally upon open
    green places, by the side of roads or rivers, upon meadows and the like
    near a town: the name often remains, though the place be altered and
    cultivated; and the lovers of antiquity, especially of the inferior
    class, always speak of them with great pleasure, and as if there were
    something extraordinary in the thing, though they cannot tell what:
    very often they are called <em>Troy town</em>. What generally appears at
    present is no more than a circular work, made of banks of earth, in
    the fashion of a maze or labyrinth; and the boys to this day divert
    themselves with running in it one after another, which leads them by
    many windings quite through and back again.</p>

  <p>Upon a little reflection I concluded that this is the ancient Roman
    game; and it is admirable that both name and thing should have
    continued through such a diversity of people; though now it is well
    nigh perished, since the last age has discouraged the innocent and
    useful sports of the common people, by an injudicious and unnecessary
    zeal for religion, which has drove them into worse methods of
    amusement. I imagine too this was a practice of the ancient Britons,
    many of which were of Phrygian extract, coming from the borders of
    Thrace; therefore derived it from the same fountain as the Romans:
    this was upon their <em>maii campi</em>; but I shall not speak of them
    here: and the Turks, I apprehend, learnt it hence; for it is their
    diversion too. As to the name <em>bower</em>, it signifies not an arbor,
    or pleasant shady retirement, in this place; but <em>borough</em>, or
    any work made with ramparts of earth, as camps and the like: and it is
    my thoughts, many works, which have been taken for camps, were only
    made for this purpose; whereof two I met with in this journey, that
    at Ashwel, and Maiden Bower near Dunstable. The name of <em>Julian</em>
    undoubtedly refers to <em>Julus</em> the son of Æneas, who first brought
    it into Italy, as is admirably described by Virgil in his V. Æneid. and
    kept up by the Romans with great pomp and annual festivity: Augustus
    was particularly fond of it, and took it as a compliment to his family.
    That they call these places <em>Troy town</em>, proves the same. Hear the
    poet:</p>

  <p class="noindent">I conceive this game was of two sorts; that performed on foot; that
    on horse-back, or in chariots: the intent of both was to exercise
    the youth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> in warlike activity, for it was a sort of mock fight:
    that on foot was the <em>Pyrrhic</em> dance. Suetonius says, <i lang="la">lusus
    ipse quem vulgo Pyrrhicum appellant Troja vocatur</i>. If we carry
    it up to its first original, we must affirm it was invented by
    the <em>Corybantes</em>, <em>Idei dactyli</em>, <em>Curetes</em>, whose
    institution, when confirmed among the Romans, was continued by
    the priests called <em>Salii</em>, dancing in armour, and clashing
    their weapons together with some sort of concert. Likewise the real
    soldiers had the same festival, which they called <em>armilustrium</em>,
    celebrated on the 19. Octob. of which Varro gives us an account <em>de
    lingua Lat.</em> Suetonius mentions it in <em>Tiberio</em>, c. 72. This,
    whether performed on foot or horse-back, by children, priests or
    soldiers, was manifestly the same thing: their gestures, turnings,
    returnings, knots and figures, their assaults, retreat, and the like,
    were aptly represented by mazes and labyrinths; which very comparison
    Virgil uses.</p>

    in a larger space of ground, of a circular or oval form, with a

    which they might more commodiously behold the sport. This I suppose was
    provided for by those bowers or burroughs mentioned, where there was
    no ditch behind; for that would be dangerous, if the people crouding
    one another, as is natural on those occasions, should thrust the

  <p class="noindent">It seems that our tournaments, so much in fashion till queen

    some degree by the common figure in dancing, called the <em>hedge</em>,

  <p>We passed by the spring of old Wintringham and the Marsh at the mouth
    of the Ankham, which is a vast tract of land left by the sea; and came
    to Feriby sluice, a stately bridge of three arches, with sluices for
    voidance of the water into the sea, but now broken down and lying in
    dismal ruins by the negligence of the undertakers: whence travellers
    are obliged to pass the river in a paltry short boat, commanded by a
    little old deaf fellow with a long beard: into this boat you descend,
    by the steep of the river, through a deep mirey clay, full of stones
    and stakes; nor is the ascent on the other side any better, both
    dangerous and difficult. This, with the hideous ruins of the bridge,
    like the picture of hell gates in Milton, and the terrible roar of the
    water passing through it, fitly represented Virgil’s description of
    Charon’s ferry: nor would a poet wish for a better scene to heighten

  <p class="noindent">When we had mounted the precipice again from the water, and paid our
    naul to the inexorable ferryman, we had several clayey lakes to ride
    over, unpassable in winter. Two roads<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> lead you to the town, a sorry
    ragged place, where upon the stocks is wrote, <em>Fear God, honour the
    King</em>. The church is set respecting no points of the compass, and
    just under the side of a precipice, so that you may almost leap from it
    upon the steeple: when we climbed the hill, it was a long while before
    we could find the way to Barton; and scarce could the people direct
    us to it, though but two miles off: at length, after wandering some
    time backward and forward, we hit upon the road, and, as men escaped
    the Stygian pool, with pleasure surveyed Barton, riding all the way
    through corn-fields, overlooking the Humber and Hull. Barton from hence
    makes a pretty prospect, having two churches, several mills, and the
    houses pleasantly intermixed with trees. This hill is wholly chalk, and
    answered on the opposite shore by another of the same nature. This is
    at present the passage across the Humber to Yorkshire, and we pleased
    ourselves at this time only with the distant view of it, and the
    neighbouring Hull: we could see the flag upon the castle.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Barrow.</span> British <i>temple</i>.</div>

  <p>At Barrow we were surprised with a castle, as the inhabitants call it,
    upon the salt marsh: upon view of the works I wondered not that they
    say it was made by Humber when he invaded Britain, in the time of the
    Trojan Brutus; for it is wholly dissonant from any thing I had seen
    before: but after sufficient <em>examen</em> I found it to be a temple of
    the old Britons, therefore to be referred to another occasion. A little
    eastward hence we visited Thornton college, a great abbey founded by
    William le Gros earl of Albemarle 1139, the gate-house is very perfect;
    a vast tower, <span class="sidenote">TAB. XVIII. 2d Vol.</span>or castle, wherein all methods of Gothic architecture for
    offence and defence are employed: there is a great ditch before it,
    across which a bridge with walls on each hand, and arches that support
    a broad battlement to defend the access: before it two low round
    towers: this stands oblique to the building, like the bridge at the
    tower-gate, the better to keep off assailants by arrows shot through
    many narrow loop-holes: there was a portcullis at the great gate, and
    behind it another gate of oak: there are no windows in front: over it
    are three old clumsy statues in as ordinary niches: a woman seeming a
    queen, or the virgin Mary: to the right, a man with a lamb; I suppose,
    St. John baptist: to the left, a bishop or abbot with a crosier: the
    lamb is introduced in several other places: in the battlements above
    the gate are the figures of men cut in stone, as looking down: on both
    sides this tower goes a strong wall embattled, supported by internal
    arches, with towers at proper distances: along the ditch within the
    gate are spacious rooms and stair-cases of good stone and rib-work
    arches. Upon taking down an old wall there, they found a man with a
    candlestick, table and book, who was supposed to have been immured.
    When you enter the spacious court, a walk of trees conducts you to the
    ruins of the church: part of the south-east corner is left between the
    choir and transept, and behind that some of the chapter-house, which
    was octagonal: the whole plan of the church is easily discoverable,
    and round about it the foundations of a quadrangle, and lodgings, to
    the south of which now stands a dwelling-house, which I suppose was
    the abbot’s lodge: here are great moats and fish-ponds, subterraneous
    vaults and passages; the whole monastery being encompassed by a deep
    ditch and high rampart, to secure the religious from robbers, because
    near the sea. A mile east of Thornton are the ruins of another great
    castle, called Kelingholme.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> In Goswel parish northward is Burham,
    a chapel now become a farm-house, which belonged to the monastery: in
    the same parish, near the Humber, is Vere court, which belonged to the
    ancient family of that name. Good land hereabouts, well wooded: they
    find Roman coins all about. Two miles west of Thornton is a great Roman
    camp, called <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Yarborough.</span> Ro. <i>town</i>.</span>Yarborough, which surveys the whole hundred denominated
    from it, and all the sea-coast. Vast quantities of Roman coins have
    been found here: Mr. Howson, of Kenington hard by, has pecks of them,
    many of Licinius.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

  <p>The town of Caster is half way down this western steep; and in nothing
    more, that I have seen, did the Romans show their fine genius for
    choice of a station, than this:<span class="sidenote">TAB. XIX. 2d Vol.</span> there is a narrow promontory juts
    forward to the west, being a rock full of springs, level at top; and on
    this did they build their town. One may easily guess at the original
    Roman scheme upon which it was founded, and now in the main preserved:
    this whole town takes in three squares of full 300 feet each, two of
    which are allotted to the castle, the third is an <em>area</em> lying
    to the east before it, between it and the hill, which is still the
    market-place: the streets are all set upon these squares, and at right
    angles: at each end are two outlets, going obliquely at the corners
    to the country round about, two above, two descending the hill thus
    distributed: the north-east to the Humber mouth, south-east to Louth,
    north-west to Wintringham, south-west to Lincoln. What is the meaning
    of this place being called <em>Thongcaster</em>,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> among some others
    in England, I know not; one in Kent: but it gave occasion to the same
    fanciful report of its original, as queen Dido’s founding Carthage
    upon as much ground as she could incompass with an ox’s hide cut into
    <em>thongs</em>; and a person in the town told me there was an history
    of the building Caster in <em>Virgil</em>, and offered to show it me.
    I should not have thought this worth mentioning, had not Mr. Camden
    spoke of it, as if he believed it to be true: but there can be no
    doubt that this castle was built long before Hengist’s time; for I saw
    enough of the old Roman wall to evince its founders: one great piece
    stands on the verge of the church-yard; another by a house: there are
    more behind the school-house in the pastures, and I have met with many
    men that have dug at its foundations in several other places: it is
    built of white rag-stone laid sometimes sideways, sometimes flat, in
    mortar exceedingly hard, full of pebbles and sand; nor is it mixed to
    any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>fineness: so that I conjecture it was the method of the Romans
    to pour the mortar on liquid, as soon as the lime was slaked: thus
    the heat and moisture, struggling together, created a most strict
    union or attraction between the lime and stone, the motion favouring
    their approximation; and the lime, no doubt, being made of the same
    stone, promoted a more intimate union between the cement and the hard
    materials by similitude of parts. I suppose this narrow tongue of land
    was thus encompassed with a wall quite to the market-place, objecting
    only its end to the plain before the hill, the rest standing upon the
    stoney precipice. From under the<span class="sidenote">TAB. XX. 2d Vol.</span> castle-walls almost quite round rise
    many quick springs; but Syfer spring is most famous, having now four
    fluxes of water from between the joints of great stones laid flat like
    a wall; and joined together with lead, probably first by the Romans,
    for it is under their wall; shaded over with trees very pleasantly:
    this is the morning and evening rendezvous of the servant-maids, where
    consequently intelligence is given of all domestic news: they say,
    within memory it ran much quicker, so that the water projected three
    or four foot from the wall; others say, that originally it ran in one
    stream like the sheet of a cascade. Syfer spring, no doubt, is the
    Saxon <em>syfer</em>, pure, clean, as the stream here deserves to be
    called. There is a place by the fold, south-west of the church, still
    called Castle-hill, where many bodies have been dug up. I am inclinable
    to think the meaning of <em>Thong-castle</em> to be fetched from <em>Thane
    Degen</em>, Saxonicè, <em>miles</em>, <em>præfectus</em>, analogous to the
    Latin <em>comes</em>.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Here it is likely our Saxon ancestors placed a
    garrison of troops to secure this country, as they conquered from the
    Roman Britons. In the church is a monumental <em>effigies</em>, in stone,
    of a knight of the name of Hundon; another, of a lady; another, of a
    knight of St. John of Jerusalem, cross-legged.</p>

  <p>In Snarford church some fine monuments, in alabaster, of the family of
    St. Paul’s. Return we now to Lindum.</p>

  <p>From hence I determined to proceed to London all the way on the Roman
    road, which perhaps has not been so scrupulously travelled upon for
    this thousand years: the intent, which I executed, was to perform the
    whole sixth journey in Antoninus his Itinerary; of which I shall give
    as complete an account as can be expected, considering how totally most
    of the stations here are erased, and that I was resolved so far to
    imitate an ancient traveller, as to dine and lie at a Roman town all
    the way if possible, and sometimes in danger of faring as meanly as a
    Roman soldier: nor could I always readily say,</p>

    I could observe myself, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>and fish out from the uncouth relations of
    the country people, who, for one half of the way, had never heard of
    enquiries of this sort since any memory, and were too apt to be morose
    upon that occasion, thinking I had some design upon their farms in my
    inquisitiveness.</p>

  <p class="clear">This<span class="sidenote"><em>Foss</em> road.</span> journey proceeds from Lincoln upon the great Foss road, as it
    tends to the Bath quite through Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire (but
    most terribly defaced) till it meets with and crosses (having gone
    sixty miles) the great Watling-street coming from Chester, and going
    to Dover, at High-cross in Warwickshire: hence to London, about ninety
    miles more, I went upon this Watling-street, which completes that
    journey of the Itinerary.</p>

  <p>I apprehend the <em>Foss</em> is the name transmitted through the
    British, which comes from <em>digging</em>, as being an artificial
    road; whence they are often called <em>dikes</em>, a word of contrary
    significations, as the Latin <em>altus</em>.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Descending southwards,
    where the Foss parts with the Hermen-street below Lincoln, by the abbey
    without the most southern gate, and passing over the river Witham
    by Bracebridge, before it comes to Lincoln; I soon perceived myself
    upon the Foss road, by its strait ridge carried over the barren moory
    ground, by a mill near Stickham. Hard by lies a stone cross of good
    height, of one piece, vulgarly called Robin Hood’s Whetstone upon the
    Foss, and is called sometimes the three-mile stone. The elevation of
    the road is still preserved, the common road going round about: it
    is much overgrown with goss, and the moor but thinly so; its strait
    length easily distinguishable for that reason: it butts a good deal
    to the east of Lincoln. Between Bracebridge and its union with the
    Hermen way, some pavement is left of flag-stone set edgewise: the
    road beyond the moor goes through the inclosures of Hikeham and
    Thorp, then enters Morton lane, very pleasantly set on both sides
    with woods full of game.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> And so journeying to the space of about
    twelve Roman miles, I found Collingham on my right hand: there is a
    high barrow or <em>tumulus</em> called Potters hill, where they say was
    a Roman pottery: it stands upon an eminence commanding a prospect
    both ways upon the road. Half a mile farther is Brough, the undoubted
    <span class="sidenote smcap">Crocolana.</span><em>Crocolana</em> of the Romans: it is three miles North of Newark.
    Great plenty of wild Saffron grows hereabouts; whence I once thought
    the name came, signifying the saffron field, from the Celtic word, a
    field or inclosure (<em>lhan.</em>)<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXI. 2d Vol.</span> In the later times of the empire,
    when they shortened words, it was called <em>Colana</em>; and some critic
    restoring <em>Croco</em> to it, doubled the second syllable; whence it
    is found in Antoninus his Itinerary, <em>Crococolanum</em>: but I judge
    Mr. Baxter’s derivation of it is right, <em>ericetum pulchrum</em>: the
    ground is very woody and pleasant, and full of goss or heath, in Welsh
    <em>grûg</em>. From <em>Colana</em>, Collinghams, two miles off, probably
    had their name,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> springing up from its ruins, as well as Newark, the
    Saxons approaching nearer the water side; the Trent and the Foss road
    being neglected, which supported the Roman town by travellers chiefly.
    Collinghams stand upon a mere or rivulet, abounding with springs called
    the Fleet, running into the Trent. The lands at Collingham belong
    to Peterborough church; probably the gift of some king:<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> they
    have a report, that one arch of South Collingham <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>church came from
    Brough, which is probably true of the whole: they say Collingham was a
    market-town before Newark; and that Brough was a famous place in time
    of the Danes, who destroyed it in Edmund Ironside’s days. Danethorp is
    hard by, the seat lately of lady Grey.</p>

  <p>At Brough no Roman token visible, but the remarkable straitness of all
    the roads and by-lanes thereabouts: the city has been most perfectly
    levelled by the plough, so that the mark of ridge and furrow remains
    in the very road: the hedge-rows were planted since. Were it not for
    many distinguishing tokens, one may be apt to conclude as Floras did,
    <i lang="la">laborat annalium fides ut Veios fuisse credamus</i>. They say here
    was a church upon a place called chapel-yard, and a font was once taken
    up there. The old landlady at the little ale-house, which is the only
    house there, till Thomas Cope’s and another were lately built, says,
    that where her fire-place is, the cross once stood; and that the whole
    is fairy ground, and very lucky to live on. There have been many Roman
    coins dug up here, and all the way between it and Newark:<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> I bought
    a large brass <em>Faustina junior</em>, lately found in the corn-field
    over-against the ale-house: in digging too they find great foundations,
    for half a mile together, on each side the road, with much rusty iron,
    iron ore and iron cinders; so that it is probable here was an eminent
    Roman forge. Across the road was a vast foundation of a wall, and part
    still remains: out of one hole they showed me, has been dug up ten or
    fifteen load of stone; so that it should seem to have been a gate: the
    stones at the foundation are observed to be placed edgewise, and very
    large ones, but not of a good sort: this was the method the Romans
    justly thought most convenient, in this springy soil; for the springs
    rise here, all about, within two foot of the surface. They told me some
    very large copper Roman coins have been found here, and silver too, and
    many pots, urns, bricks, &amp;c. they call the money Brough pennies. The
    earl of Stanford is lord of the manor, and all is copy-hold, probably
    originally in the crown. The country people have a notion that the Foss
    road is the oldest in England, and that it was made by William the
    Conqueror. This is all that I could learn of this city, which I thought
    no contemptible gleaning from the shipwreck of time; for</p>

  <p class="noindent">is true of all the stations of this whole journey, more or less; and I
    was glad when any part of the harvest might be applied to the gathering
    of antiquities. From hence the road goes extremely strait to Newark
    between hedge-rows, having the steeple before us as a visto: but, much
    to their disgrace, it is in very ill repair; nay, in some places they
    dig the very stone and gravel out of it to mend their streets.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Newark.</div>

  <p>Newark was certainly raised from the neighbouring Roman cities, and has
    been walled about with their remains: the northern and eastern gate,
    still left, are composed of stones seemingly of a Roman cut; and not
    improbably the Romans themselves had a town here; for many antiquities
    are found round about it,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> especially by the Foss side, which runs
    quite through the town. My friend the reverend Mr. Warburton, of this
    place, gave me a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>coin or two dug up here; and likewise this further
    information, that lately a gentleman (Mr. Holden) digging to plant some
    trees by the Foss road side, discovered four urns lying in a strait
    line, and at equal distances: they were soon broke in pieces by the
    workmen, imagining to find treasure therein: in one there was only a
    rude piece of brass, about the bulk of a small walnut, half melted
    down, with a bit of bone and some of the ashes sticking in the surface
    thereof, amidst the other burnt bones and ashes: he conjectured that
    it was a <em>fibula</em> belonging to the habit of the dead: there were
    square earthen beads in others, which seem to be British: in another
    was a small brass <em>lar</em> about an inch and half long, but much
    consumed by rust: he told me likewise a pot of Roman money was found at
    Carlton-scrope near them. There are two fine stone crosses at Newark:
    the market-place is a spacious square: the church is very large and
    handsome, with a very high steeple.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

  <p>From Newark the Foss passes by Queen’s Sconce, one of the great forts
    erected in the civil wars, and so along the Trent side by Stoke, famous
    for a battle, and an inn called the Red inn. We arrived, at about six
    miles distance south of Newark, to the station of the Romans called
    <span class="sidenote smcap">Ad Pontem.</span><i lang="la">Ad pontem</i>. East Bridgford lies near a mile to the right upon
    the river Trent:<span class="sidenote">TAB. XC.</span> doubtless there was the bridge over the river, which
    created the denomination, in the Roman times, as being the passage from
    the eastern parts to those beyond the Trent: and as to this particular
    station upon the road, perhaps a bridge was the sign of the inn, that
    travellers might know where to turn out for that purpose, for I cannot
    suppose here was a bridge at the road. At Bridgford they told us there
    were formerly great buildings and cellars on the right as you descend
    to the Trent, and a quay upon the river for vessels to unlade at.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
    The Roman station upon the Foss I found to be called Boroughfield,
    west of the road: here a spring arises under the hedge, called Oldwork
    spring, very quick, running over a fine gravel; the only one hereabouts
    that falls eastward, not directly into the neighbouring Trent, towards
    Newton. Hereabouts I saw the Roman foundations of walls, and floors
    of houses, composed after the manner before spoken, of stones set
    edgewise in clay, and liquid mortar run upon them: there are likewise
    short oaken posts or piles at proper intervals, some whereof I pulled
    up with my own hands. Dr. Batteley tells us of oak very firm, found
    at Reculver, under the Roman cisterns: the earth all around looks
    very black: they told us that frequently the stones were laid upon
    a bed of pease-straw and rush-rope or twisted hay, which remained
    very perfect. Houses stood all along upon the Foss, whose foundations
    have been dug up, and carried to the neighbouring villages. They told
    us too of a most famous pavement near the Foss way: close by, in a
    pasture, Castle-hill close, has been a great building, which they say
    was carried all to Newark. John Green <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>of Bridgeford, aged 80, told me
    that he has taken up large foundations there, much ancient coin, and
    small earthen pipes for water: his father, aged near 100, took up many
    pipes fourscore yards off the castle, and much fine free-stone: some
    well cut and carved: there have been found many urns, pots, and Roman
    bricks; but the people preserved none of them; and some that had coins
    would by no means let us see them, for fear we were come from the lord
    of the manor. About a mile farther is a <em>tumulus</em> upon an eminence
    of the road beyond Bingham lane, a fine prospect to Belvoir castle,
    Nottingham, the Trent, &amp;c. whence I took a small sketch of the road we
    had passed, regretting the oblivion of so many famous antiquities.</p>

  <p>In my journey forwards, upon the declension of a stiff clayey hill,
    near the lodge upon the wolds, an inn under a great wood. The pavement
    upon the road is very manifest, of great blue flag-stones laid edgewise
    very carefully: the quarries whence they took them are by the side
    of the hill: this pavement is a hundred foot broad, or more; but all
    the way thence it has been intirely paved with red flints, seemingly
    brought from the sea-coasts: these are laid, with the smoothest face
    upwards, upon a bed of gravel over the clayey marl, which reaches
    beyond Margidunum; that we may well say,</p>

  <p class="noindent">This pavement is very broad, and visible where not covered with dirt,
    and especially in the frequent breaches thereof. They preserve a report
    still, that it was thus paved all the way from Newark to Leicester,
    and that the Foss way went through Leicester shambles: the yard of the
    lodge in the wold is paved with these same stones plundered from the
    road. June 15, 1728, Mr. L. Hurst, of Grantham, told me he saw at Mr.
    Gascoign’s, a goldsmith in Newark, a large gold ring weighing 42s.
    lately brought him by a countryman, which he found upon the Foss-way.
    There was a seal upon the gold; a fox (he thought) engraved under a
    tree. Afterward I bought the seal: it is a wolf under a tree. Perhaps
    Norman. AD PONTEM.</p>

  <p>Willughby brook is the next water. When arrived over-against Willughby
    on the wold on the right, Upper and Nether Broughton on the left, you
    find a <em>tumulus</em> on Willughby side of the road, famous among
    the country people: it is called Cross hill: upon this they have an
    anniversary festival: the road parts the two lordships; but the name
    of Broughton set me to work to find the Roman town, among the people
    getting in harvest. After some time I perceived I was upon the spot,
    being a field called Henings, by which I suppose is meant the ancient
    meadows: this is upon the brow of the hill overlooking Willughby brook,
    rising in Dalby lordship, and playing in pretty meanders along a valley
    between corn-fields, with a moderate water unless raised by rains.
    Here they said had been an old city, called Long Billington: it is
    often called the Black field in common discourse, from the colour and
    excessive richness of the soil, so that they never lay any manure upon
    it. Here is a place called Thieves, and on the other side of the valley
    a place called Wells, near where now a barn stands: and all this length
    they say the city reached, and that there was a church on the top of
    Wells; but the city was mostly on Willughby side; for the land on the
    other side in Broughton lordship is poor, whilst this is luxuriant to
    the last degree; so that a farmer once happening to set his sheep-fold
    here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> it rotted the corn upon the spot; and often he has been
    forced to mow the blade before it spindled (in their way of talking.)
    The soil is perfectly black, though all the circumjacent land be red,
    especially north of the valley upon the edge of the hill, and where
    most antiquities are found; which certainly was the true place, whence
    the Roman name, signifying a marly hill. Richard Cooper, aged 72, has
    found many brass and silver coins here: there have been some of gold.
    They have a notion of great riches being under ground, and a vulgar
    report that one balk, or mere, (i. e. a division between the ploughed
    fields) has as much money under it, as would purchase the whole
    lordship: but people have been frighted from digging it by spirits;
    and several pleasant stories are told thereupon. They have likewise
    a tradition that the city was destroyed by <em>thieves</em>, perhaps
    from the place so called. Many Mosaic pavements have been dug up: my
    landlord Gee of Willughby says, he has upon ploughing met with such
    for five yards together, as likewise coins, pot-hooks, fire-shovels
    and the like utensils, and many large brass coins, which they took for
    weights, ounces and half-ounces, but upon trial found them somewhat
    less. Broad stones and foundations are frequent upon the side of the
    Foss: several found at Wells. The ground naturally is so stiff a marl,
    that at Willughby town they pave their yards with stones, fetched from
    the Foss way even to the slope of their pits, for the cattle to drink
    at. At Over and Nether Broughton, and Willughby too, the coins are so
    frequent, that you hear of them all the country round. There is a fine
    prospect from Wells hill every way, whence I drew a little view of the
    place.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XI.</span> In Willughby town is a handsome cross of one stone, five yards
    long: in the time of the reforming rebellion the soldiers had tied
    ropes about it to pull it down; but the vicar persuaded them to commute
    for some strong beer, having made an harangue to show the innocence
    thereof. Richard Cooper likewise told me of a pot of Roman money found
    at Wilford near Nottingham.</p>

  <p>In passing forwards towards Leicester, between here and the river Wrek,
    I found the Foss road began to be very obscure, not only where it
    has been ploughed up in some places, but where it goes over a grassy
    common: the reason is, travellers have quite worn it away, because of
    the badness of the roads; and the negligence of the people so far from
    repairing it, that they take away the materials. Moreover, you are oft
    in danger of losing it through the many intersections of cross roads;
    and sometimes it is inclosed with pastures, or passes under the sides
    of a wood: therefore upon every hill-top I made an observation of some
    remarkable object on the opposite high ground, which continued the
    right line; so that by going strait forwards I never failed of meeting
    it again. I observed too, that at such a time of the day exactly, the
    sun was perpendicular to the road; for it continues the same bearing
    throughout: this I tried by the compass soon after I left Lincoln,
    and when I came to High-cross, where it crosses the Watling-street,
    and at intermediate places; finding it always butted upon the same
    degree, to surprising exactness. At Abketilby in the vale of Belvoir,
    and thereabouts, in the quarries is a vein of rag-stone wholly made of
    shells, covered with a thin vein of good hewing stone: this is in one
    corner of that great vale, under the Lincolnshire <em>Alpes</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Shipley-Hill</span> Br <i>barrow</i>.</div>

  <p>At Cossington (just before I came to the river Wrek, parting the
    counties) is a vast barrow, 350 foot long, 120 broad, 40 high or near
    it: it is very handsomely worked up on the sides, and very steep: it
    seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> lost some of its length at both ends, especially the
    northern, a torrent running close by: it stands exactly north and
    south, upon the very edge of the ings; and in wet times it must be
    almost incompassed with water: they call it Shipley hill, and say a
    great captain called Shipley was buried there. I doubt not but this is
    of great antiquity, and Celtic, and that the intent of it is rightly
    preserved by the country people; but as to the name of him I can say
    nothing. On the top are several oblong double trenches cut in the
    turf, where the lads and lasses of the adjacent villages meet upon
    Easter-Monday yearly, to be merry with cakes and ale. I observed upon
    the Foss, all along, that in almost every parish were such like tables,
    for the same purpose; and such a one I formerly found at Rowldrich
    stones in Oxfordshire. Near this place, at Radcliff, so called from the
    road, it seems that the Foss road passes over this brook, and filling
    up its cavity, made it necessary to cut a new channel, that the road
    might run strait, and like the Roman <em>terminus</em> give place to
    nothing. Having passed the river, it proceeds over the meadows: just
    beyond them is a large round <em>tumulus</em>, which I suppose Roman:
    then the road goes strait through Thumarton, and ends full upon the
    east gate of Leicester. But before we speak of this station, we must
    with the Itinerary make an excursion to take in <em>Vernometum</em>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Vernometum.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XXII 2d Vol.</div>

  <p>There seems to be no Roman way between <em>Ratæ</em> and
    <em>Vernometum</em>;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> but coming from <em>Margidunum</em>, you turn out
    of the road by Sison over-against Radcliffe before mentioned. This
    place is Borough, or Erdborough, i. e. the earthy camp, in Gartre
    hundred east of Leicester. It is a very great Roman camp upon a very
    high hill, the north-west tip of a ridge of hills, and higher than any
    other part of it, of a most delightful and extensive prospect, reaching
    as far as Lincoln one way: the fortification takes in the whole summit
    of the hill; the high rampire is partly composed of vast loose stones
    piled up and covered with turf: it is of an irregular figure, humouring
    the form of the ground, nearly a square, and conformed to the quarters
    of the heavens: its length lies east and west, the narrowest end
    eastward: it is about 800 foot long, and for the most part there is a
    ditch besides the rampire, to render the ascent still more difficult
    to assailants: the entrance is south-west at a corner from a narrow
    ridge: here two rampires advance inwards, like the sides of a gate,
    for greater strength: within is a rising hill about the middle, and
    they say that vaults have been found thereabouts. Antiquarians talk
    of a temple, which possibly may have been there, and in the time of
    the Britons: thus the old <em>Fanum</em> of Apollo at Delphos was in a
    concavity on the top of a hill. The name of <em>Vernometum</em> signifies
    a sacred plain, as they tell us from authority. It contains about
    sixteen acres: several springs rise from under the hill on all sides,
    and I observed the rock thereof is composed intirely of sea-shells:
    they frequently carry away the stones that form the rampires, to mend
    the roads with. The town itself is now but a small village. There is
    another Roman castle southward near Tilton, but not so big as Borough
    hill: a petrifying spring near it, and a Roman road, as thought,
    called Long Hedges. I am not without suspicion that the true name is
    <em>Verometum</em>, and must be sought for somewhere near a river.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XCII.</div>

  <p>Leicester is the <em>Ratæ Coritanorum</em> of the Romans. The trace
    of the Roman wall quite round is discoverable without difficulty,
    especially in the gardens about Senvy gate: there was a ditch on the
    outside, very visible in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>the gardens thereabouts: it
    is 2500 Roman feet long, and as much broad towards the south-east, 2000
    Roman feet broad to the north-west: this was repaired by Edelfleda,
    a noble Saxon lady, anno 914. but the stories in Mr. Camden, of the
    piles it stood on, and the indissoluble tenacity of the mortar, seem
    meant of the Roman work. The streets run in the manner we observed
    of <em>Camboritum</em>, the length of the city being from north-west
    to south-east. There is a Roman musive pavement in a cellar, in part
    remaining, of a person standing by a deer, Cupid drawing his bow,
    delineated in differently-coloured small stones as usual.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The
    old work called Jewry wall is composed of rag-stone and Roman brick:<span class="sidenote">TAB. LV.</span>
    several fragments and foundations are in all the houses hereabouts of
    this building, whatever it were, as well as in the adjacent church,<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXIII. 2d Vol.</span>
    which seems to be built in the very <em>area</em> of it, and out of its
    ruins. Not far off is a place called Holy Bones, where abundance of
    bones of oxen have been dug up, the <em>exuvia</em> of their sacrifices:
    this is however a most noble piece of Roman antiquity, and I lament
    it should be so much abused. Many Roman coins are found at Leicester:
    at the entrance into White Friers a pot full dug up about five
    years ago, and many great foundations. At St. Mary de Pree’s abbey
    they dug up a body, about three years ago, which they supposed to
    be cardinal Wolsey’s: in this abbey is nought worth seeing, but a
    pleasant terrace-walk, supported by an embattled wall, with lunettes
    hanging over the river and shadowed with trees. The little remains of
    the old building are new modelled by later hands, and scarce to be
    distinguished: it was made a dwelling-house since the Dissolution; and
    that is now spoiled of floors, roof, and windows; and the naked walls
    are left to daily ruin and pillage: the spot of the abbey is turned
    into a garden: they show us a place in it, where has been much search
    for the famous cardinal’s body; but it did not seem to me a likely
    place. The church, though wholly erased, did not probably come out
    so far toward the river: indeed there is thorough work made of all
    the religious houses at Leicester, and scarce one stone left in its
    original site. St. Margaret’s church was a bishop’s see in the time of
    the Saxon kings. Within the castle is a collegiate hospital, founded
    by Henry earl of Lancaster, who with his son Henry duke of Lancaster
    lie buried in the chapel: the church was very fine, demolished in the
    Suppression. Here, say some, was buried Richard III. this castle was
    built by Simon de Montfort. There is a very pretty arch reaching across
    the river, called Bowbridge, at Black Friers, under which they have a
    notion that king Richard III. was buried; which seems to allude to the
    British romance that tells of king Lear being buried here. Half a mile
    southward from Leicester, upon the edge of the meadows is a long ditch
    called Rawdikes:<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Rawdikes</span> <i>a</i> Br. <i>cursus</i>.</span> upon view of the place I found it to be a British
    <em>cursus</em>. King Charles I. when besieging Leicester, lay at the
    vicarage-house at Elston;<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXIV. XXV. XXVI. XXVII. 2d Vol.</span> and during the storm of the town, when his
    men took and pillaged it, he stood, as they report, upon the banks of
    this Rawdikes. About February 1721–2. a tesselated pavement was found
    the other side the river, about Wanlip, with coins of Constantine,
    broken urns, a human scull, &amp;c. a foundation by it, doubtless of the
    house that covered it.</p>

  <p>Soon after you go from Leicester, taking the Foss at Bronstongate, you
    come to some inclosures and troublesome gates across the road: here
    they have fenced it out into a narrow scantling, scarce the breadth
    of a coach, to the shame as well as the detriment of the country,
    suffering so scandalous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>an incroachment. I travelled by Narborough
    on the west side of the river, and a very wet journey under foot for
    one that was resolved to keep upon the road: sometimes I rode half
    a mile up to the horse’s belly in water upon the Roman pavement.
    The river Soar running near its east side, it is carried over many
    bogs, quags, and springs, for miles together, with a visible pavement
    of great round coggles by Sharnford, so called from the causeway:
    approaching High-cross it enters inclosures again, and is crossed by
    some more lakes scarce passable. Just upon the edge of Leicestershire
    and Warwickshire, at High-cross, I met the Watling-street, my future conductor.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Benonis.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XCIII.</div>

  <p>Benonis stands in the intersection of the two great Roman roads that
    trathe kingdom obliquely, and seems to be the centre of England,
    and highest ground; for from hence rivers run every way. The Foss
    went across the back-side of the inn, and so towards Bath. The ground
    hereabouts, the site of the ancient city, is very rich; and many
    antiquities, stones, Roman bricks, &amp;c. have been dug up: Roman coins
    were found when they ploughed the field west of the cross.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Much
    <em>ebulus</em> grows here, sought for in cure of dropsies. Claybroke
    lane has a bit of an old quick-set hedge left across it, betokening one
    side of the Foss: the bearing of the Foss here is exactly north-east
    and south-west, as upon the moor on this side Lincoln. In the garden
    before the inn was a <em>tumulus</em> lately taken away: under it they
    found the body of a man upon the plain surface, as likewise under
    several others hereabouts upon the Watling-street. Foundations of
    houses have been frequently dug up along the street here, all the
    way to Cleycester. Here is a cross of handsome design, but of a
    mouldering stone, through the villainy of the architect, one Dunkley,
    built at the charge of the late earl of Denbigh, and the gentlemen in
    the neighbourhood: it consists of four Doric columns regarding the
    four roads, with a gilded globe and cross a-top upon a sun-dial: on
    two sides, between the four Tuscan pillars, that compose a sort of
    pedestal, are these inscriptions.</p>

    up along all the roads. It commands a charming prospect to <em>Ratæ</em>,

  <p>Being now got upon the Watling-street, I made this remark of it, that
    it is the direct road to Rome: for take a ruler, and lay it in a map
    of Europe from Chester through London and Dover, and it makes a strait
    line with Rome: so the great founders had this satisfaction when they
    travelled upon it, that they were ever going upon the line that led
    to the imperial Capitol. Our antiquarians are much at a loss, after
    torturing of words and languages, to find out the reason of the name
    of this street, which is so notorious, that many other by-roads of the
    Romans, in different parts of the kingdom, have taken the same, and it
    became almost the common appellative of such roads. My judgment of it
    is this: it is natural to denominate great roads from the places they
    tend to, as the Icening-street from the Iceni: the Akeman-street is
    said to come from Akemancester: in Wiltshire, and other places, the
    way to Exeter they call the Exeter road, though a hundred mile off:
    so the London road is every where inquired for as the most remarkable
    place: thus <em>Watling-street</em>, tending directly to Ireland, no
    doubt was called the Irish road, that is the <em>Gathelian</em> road,
    <em>Gathelin-street</em>; whence our present word <em>Wales</em> from
    <em>Gauls</em>, <em>warden</em> from <em>guardian</em>, &amp;c. <cite>Scoti qui &amp;
    Gaidelii</cite> says <em>ogygia extera</em>. Whether there be any thing
    in the story of Gathelus, as founder of the Irish, I do not concern
    myself at present; but their language is called <em>Gaothela</em>: so
    Mr. Camden says the true genuine Scots own not that name, but call
    themselves <em>gaoithel</em>, <em>gaiothlac</em>, as coming from Ireland;
    and that they glory in this name: and there is no dispute but this is
    the ancient appellative of the Irish,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> which the learned Mr. Edward
    Lluyd has turned into <em>Gwydhelians</em>: and this name, which has
    superseded that which the Romans gave it, (whatever it was) seems to
    show there was such a road in the ancient times of the Britons, as the
    track of the trade between Ireland and the continent; yet it must be
    owned nought but Roman hands reduced it to the present form.</p>

  <p>Hence-forward we turn our course upon the Gathelin-street directly for
    London along with the Itinerary. The road is now altogether between
    hedge-rows, very clayey and bad, full of lakes and mires, through the
    intolerable negligence of the inhabitants: here and there they have
    stupidly mended it, by making a ditch in the middle of the road to
    raise a bank of earth; for which they ought rather to be punished than
    commended.</p>

  <p>I turned out of the road to the west, through some inclosures, to see
    Cester-over, induced by the name. I found a house in a little square
    deeply intrenched upon the side of a hill, but the earth rather thrown
    outward than inward as a <em>vallum</em>, and the level within much
    lower than the field around it. I perceived it was a religious house;
    some part of the building left; and without the ditch a fine chapel,
    built of brick with good stone coins and mullioned windows, converted
    into a barn: and a-cross a valley hard by I saw dams, or stanks, for
    fish-ponds. The people within could give me no manner of intelligence,
    having but lately come thither. I fancied it to have been a nunnery,
    and that it was called <em>Sister-over</em>, to distinguish it from
    other neighbouring towns; as <em>Church-over</em>, <em>Browns-over</em>,
    <i>&amp;c.</i> but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>afterwards I learnt from other hands that there is a
    close called Old-town, where they dig up foundations, being very rich
    land (said to have been a city) lord Brook possessor.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Tripontium.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XCIV.</div>

  <p>Thence passing a rivulet, from Bensford bridge<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> I came to
    <em>Tripontium</em>, placed in a sweet little valley, but the sides
    pretty steep: the road on the opposite hill looks perfectly like a
    perspective scene at the play-house. This is the next Roman station,
    which is rightly placed at Dovebridge upon the Avon, running by Rugby
    to Warwick. The stream here divides into two, with a bridge over
    each: upon one a stone inscription, very laconic, showing the three
    counties that repair it. The first syllable of <em>Tripontium</em> has
    relation to the old British word <em>tre</em>, a town or fortification:
    the remainder is generally thought to signify a bridge; but it is not
    to be imagined the Romans would make a bridge over this rill, or one
    so eminently <span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>large as to denominate the town: indubitably it comes
    from the British word <em>pant</em>, a little valley as this is, and
    remarkably so; which the Britons pronouncing broad, created the Latin
    <em>Tripontium</em>. Here are no manner of remains of antiquity, but the
    distances on each hand ascertain this the place: hard by antiquities
    have been found both at Cathorp and Lilburn, one on the north, the
    other on the south of the river; so that the Roman city stood on both
    sides. Castle hills, a place at Lilburn, where are some old walls:
    Camden speaks of it. Mr. Morton has treated largely on this station, to
    whom I refer the reader. The neighbouring Newton probably succeeded it,
    and then Rugby.</p>

  <p>When we mount the next hill there is a lovely prospect as far as
    Watford-gap, four miles off, a great vale or rather level meadow lying
    between, a-cross which the road is drawn: and hereabouts the ridge of
    it is very high for miles together: the nature of the way, on both
    sides being stoney, has spared it. Several <em>tumuli</em> upon the road;
    bodies found under them: this shows the Romans did not travel upon
    them on horse-back. Watford-gap is a convenient inn for antiquaries
    to supply the mansion of <em>Tripontium</em>, which I think proper to
    advertise them of: it has a pleasant prospect of the road northwards:
    it is a high hill, and a rock of stone six foot under the surface,
    which is softish; then a bed of clay; under that a blue hard stone of
    good depth: below this rock it is springy, and at the bottom by the
    meadows are many quick springs. At Legers Ashby near here has been
    another old town, as they say, destroyed by the Danes: there are great
    ditches, causeways, and marks of streets. Catesby owned the town, who
    hatched the powder-plot. I went out of the road through Norton to see
    a great camp called<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Burrow hill.</span> Ro. <i>camp</i>.</span> Burrow hill, upon the north end of a hill covered
    over with fern and goss: here is a horse-race kept; and the whole
    hill-top, which is of great extent, seems to have been fortified: but
    the principal work upon the end of it is squarish, double ditched, of
    about twelve acres: the inner ditch is very large, and at one corner
    has a spring: the <em>vallum</em> is but moderate: a squarish work
    within, upon the highest part of the camp, like a <em>prætorium</em>.
    They say this was a Danish camp; and every thing hereabouts is
    attributed to the <em>Danes</em>, because of the neighbouring
    <em>Daventre</em>, which they suppose to be built by them: the road
    hereabouts too being overgrown with <em>dane-weed</em>, they fancy it
    sprung from the blood of the Danes slain in battle, and that, if upon
    a certain day in the year you cut it, it bleeds. As to the camp, I
    believe it to be originally Roman; but that it has been occupied by
    some other people, and perhaps the Danes, who have new modelled it,
    and made new works to it. Consult Mr. Moreton, who has discoursed very
    largely about it. Much <em>cotyledon</em> and <em>ros solis</em> grow in
    the springs hereabouts: the stone is red and sandy, and brim-full of
    shells. I saw a fine <i>cornu ammonis</i> lie neglected in Norton town
    road, too big to bring away, and where they have fresh mended the
    Watling-street with this stone; it was an amusement for some miles to
    view the shells in it. Hereabouts the road is overgrown with grass and
    trefoil, being well nigh neglected for badness, and the trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> wholly
    turned another way, by Coventry, for that reason. Between the head of
    the Leam and this Avon is<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Arbury Hill.</span> Ro. <i>camp</i>.</span> Arbury hill in view, another Roman camp, upon
    a very high hill; notoriously made for a guard between the two rivers.</p>

  <p>The next station the Watling-street leads us to is Weedon on the
    street; beyond dispute <span class="sidenote smcap">Benavona.</span><i>Benavona</i>, as surely it ought to be
    wrote, being situate on the head of the <em>Aufona</em>, running to
    <em>Northavonton</em>, or Northampton.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXVIII. 2d Vol.</span> This too affords but little matter
    for the antiquary. The old town seems to have been in two pastures west
    of the road, and south of the church, called Upper Ash-close and Nether
    Ash-close, or the Ashes; in which are manifest vestiges of the ditch
    and rampart that surrounded it, and many marks of great foundations:
    they show you the site of king Wolfhere’s palace, the Saxon kings
    of this province having their seat here. The Ashes was the Roman
    <em>castrum</em>: here was a chapel of St. Werberg, daughter of king
    Wolfhere, abbess to the nunnery in this place: there has been dug up
    abundance of very fine stone, and many Roman coins. Now Weedon consists
    of two parishes, and has been a market-town. There is a large Roman
    camp a little higher toward the river-head, southward a mile, as much
    from Watling-street, called <span class="sidenote smcap">Castledikes.</span>Castledikes, probably one of those made by
    P. Ostorius Scapula, <em>proprætor</em> under Claudius. Roman coin and
    pavements have been found there. I visited the place: it is of a very
    pleasant and healthful situation, being in a wood on the top of a dry
    hill: probably it was a Roman villa, afterwards rendered Saxon: a house
    stands by it. Another of these camps of Scapula I mentioned before,
    at Guildsborough. At Nether Hayford, on the other side the road, anno
    1699, a Roman Mosaic pavement was found, of which Mr. Moreton gives us
    a drawing, but in too small a compass.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Lactorodum.</div>

  <p>Towcester is a considerable town between two rivulets; but what
    its Roman name, time has envied us, the Itinerary passing it by.
    <em>Lactorodum</em> is the next station, being Old Stretford, on the
    opposite side of the Ouse to Stony Stretford: many Roman coins have
    been found in the fields thereabouts, and queen Eleanor’s cross stood
    a little north of the Horse-shoe inn, pulled down in the rebellion;
    which shows that the town was on this side the bridge in the time of
    Edward I. Mr. Baxter says, the name imports the ford over the water. My
    friend Browne Willys esq; who lives in the neighbourhood, has inquired
    into the antiquities of this place, and gives us an account of them in
    his curious Treatise of Burroughs, which it is to be wished he would
    continue. A little on this side Stretford, to the west, upon very high
    ground stands Whaddon hall, Mr. Willys’s seat; it has a most delicate
    prospect: this manor formerly belonged to the lords Grey; one, a knight
    of the garter, lies buried in the church. Spencer the poet lived here,
    and the learned duke of Bucks. Here is the original picture of Dr.
    Willys: I saw many of his MSS. letters, consultations, lectures, and
    other works unprinted.</p>

  <p>Still higher stands Stukeley, a very large parish, on the same sort
    of soil as that in Huntingdonshire. This is the oldest church, and
    most intire, I ever saw, undoubtedly before the Conquest, in the plain
    ancient manner, being a parallelogram of four squares: two are allotted
    to the church; one covered by the steeple, which stands between it and
    the choir, carried across the church upon two round arches; one square
    to the choir, which is vaulted over with stone: the windows are small,
    with semi-circular arches, and few in number: at the west end are three
    arches, the door in the middlemost: the whole of a very good manner of
    symmetry.</p>

  <p>Thus far we have gone through Northamptonshire and Bucks: now we
    enter Bedfordshire, and arrive at <span class="sidenote smcap">Magiovinium.</span><em>Magiovinium</em>, or Dunstable.
    The road hither from Fenny Stretford is deep sand (and comes from
    <em>Salinæ</em>, or <em>sandy</em>) till you arrive at the bottom of
    the chalk-hills, or <em>chiltern</em>, which arise very steep on this
    side, as being north-west, conform to my assumption, p. 4. The town
    stands upon this chalk; whence its Roman name, importing the white
    town:<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> it consists of four streets, intersecting at right angles,
    but oblique to the cardinal points, because such is the direction of
    the Icening and Watling-street, which here meet. In the centre stood
    one of those beautiful crosses of queen Eleanor; but fanatic zeal has
    robbed the town of this ornament. This being a high situation, and no
    running water near, they are forced to draw up their water, from very
    deep wells, by machinery of great wheels. Kingsbury, the royal seat
    over-against the church, is now a farm-house. The church is composed of
    many parts tacked together, some very old: it was part of the priory:
    arch-bishop Cranmer was the last prior here. In Dunstable church is
    this inscription,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="antiqua noindent" lang="la">Hic iacent Nicholaus Lane quondam presidens frat’nitat’<br>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Maiden Bower.</span> British.</div>

  <p class="noindent">I visited Maiden-Bower,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> mentioned by Mr. Camden, but cannot think
    its name has any relation to that of the town: though Roman coins
    have been found here, I am persuaded it is a British work, like that
    at Ashwell, at like distance from the Chiltern, and of like form, but
    more circular: it stands upon a plain, but not far from the edge of a
    lesser eminence of these hills, about a little mile from Dunstable: the
    rampire is pretty high, but very little sign of a ditch; nor do I think
    there ever was much more: it incloses about nine acres: the ground
    round it is ploughed: this chalk yields good wheat. Between here and
    the town is a long barrow called the Mill-hill, no doubt from a mill
    which was afterwards set upon it; the ends of it ploughed somewhat: it
    stands east and west: I have no scruple in supposing it Celtic. <span class="sidenote">Tumuli <i>British</i>.</span>A high
    prominence of the Chiltern overlooks all, called the Five Knolls, from
    that number of barrows, or Celtic <em>tumuli</em>, round, pretty large,
    and ditched about upon the very <em>apex</em> of the hill. Close by are
    two round cavities, as often observed in Wiltshire. The Icening-street
    runs under the bottom. These chalk hills have frequently veins of
    strong clay intermixed, and the like between these hills and the sand
    more northward. This great tract of chalk comes from the eastern
    sea, and traverses the kingdom much in a like direction with the
    Icening-street.</p>

  <p>At Woburn is some fullers earth. There was a noble abbey, now the seat
    of the duke of Bedford; in it several valuable works of Inigo Jones
    left, particularly a curious grotto.</p>

  <p>From Dunstable the Itinerary leads us out of the road, going strait to
    Verolam, and takes in another station by the way, <span class="sidenote smcap">Durocobrivis.</span><em>Durocobrivis</em>;
    which demonstrates it was made not so much for travellers, as for
    the soldiery or officers that were to visit the garrisons, therefore
    comprehends as many <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>as could conveniently be taken into that route.
    About this station antiquaries have been much divided, when it
    certainly ought to be placed at Berghamsted, commonly Barkamstead,
    in <span class="sidenote">TAB XXIX. 2d Vol.</span>Hertfordshire, which well suits the assigned distances from
    <em>Magiovinium</em>, and the subsequent <em>Verolanium</em>, and has
    evidently been a Roman town, as its name imports; and probably the
    castle there stands upon a Roman foundation. It is certain Roman coins
    are frequently dug up there: my friend Mr. Browne Willys has a Roman
    coin, found there: young Mr. Whitfield, brother to the major at St.
    Alban’s, has many Roman coins, great and small, found in the castle
    at Berghamsted. The inside, within the walls where the lodgings were,
    is about two acres: the entrance was not at the corner, where now,
    but in the front of the south side: many chimneys remain in the wall,
    of the lodgings which extended quite round, leaving a spacious court
    within; and all the windows looked inward: the ground of the court is
    distinguishable, being good soil, and there they find the Roman coins;
    the rest is rubbish and foundations; so that the Saxon castle was made
    upon the Roman: the chapel seems to have stood against the west wall,
    where be signs of a stair-case: the walls are of flints gathered from
    the highlands, very thick, and laid with strong mortar. This town fully
    answers the distance in the Itinerary, and remarkably the import of
    the name, according to Mr. Baxter’s derivation, though he erroneously
    places it at Woburn, <i lang="la">civitas paludosi profluentis</i>; for here is
    a large marsh, or bog, wherein the ancient British <em>oppidum</em> was
    placed: it is most sweetly surrounded with high, hard, and pleasant
    ground all around, full of hedge-rows, pastures, and arable: the castle
    was set very judiciously in the north side, upon a piece of dry ground,
    incompassed with springs, by the Saxons made exceedingly strong. The
    town is upon the south side of the marsh, stretching itself a good
    length in handsome buildings, and a broad street: the church is a large
    handsome building, a monumental <em>effigies</em> of a knight and a lady;
    upon his coat a bend or belt, and in the sinister chief a martlet; a
    lion his crest under his feet: it is full of chapels and monuments old
    and new. This town has been an old corporation; the kings of Mercia
    resided here; Wightred, king of Kent and Mercia, anno 697, held a
    parliament here; and here king Ina’s laws were published: all which
    further confirm its being the place we assert.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

  <p>Near is Ashridge, an abbey, now the seat of the duke of Bridgewater;
    a park finely wooded, especially with tall beech-trees full of mast.
    Hereabouts I observed many great stones composed wholly of little
    pebbles; others, of larger pebbles or flints petrified together
    exceeding hard. Near Ricmeresworth, at Moor park, Mr. Styles, digging a
    hill away, found veins of sea-sand with mussels in them, and many other
    curious particulars.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Verolanium.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XCV.</div>

  <p>We come again into the Watling-street at <em>Verolanium</em>. I need say
    little here, after Mr. Camden, Chancey, Weaver, and others. This was
    the famous <em>municipium</em> of the Romans, destroyed by Boadicia. The
    form of the city is depicted in <a href="#i_116_2">plate 95</a>. in one part the ditch is
    double, but irregularly formed. I imagine the outermost was the only
    fence of the first city, which Boadicia destroyed before the walls
    were built, and these reduced it into a more square form; to which
    the inner ditch belonged. In some measure the track of the streets is
    visible, when the corn first comes up, or is nearly ripe: three years
    ago good part of the wall was standing; but ever <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>since, out of
    wretched ignorance, even of their own interest, they have been pulling
    it up all around, to the very foundations, to mend the highway; and
    I met hundreds of cart-loads of Roman bricks, &amp;c. carrying for that
    purpose, as I now rode through the old city, though they may have
    stone cheaper, because of the prodigious strength of the mortar, so
    that they cannot get up one whole brick in a thousand. The composition
    of the Roman wall is three foot layers of flint, and one foot made up
    of three courses of Roman brick: there are round holes quite through
    the wall, at about eight yards distance, in that corner still left by
    St. German’s chapel: another great piece of the wall is left by the
    west gate, called Gorham Block; it is always twelve foot thick. I saw
    a little brass <em>lar</em>, or <em>genius alatus</em>; another curious
    antiquity, of a brass knife-handle with odd faces and figures on it,
    now in possession of Sir Robert Cornwall, baronet; a little urn of
    white earth two inches and quarter high: part of a great wine-jar,
    20 inches high, two foot diameter, in St. Michael’s vestry; another
    such in St. Alban’s church. In St. Michael’s church sleeps the great
    naturalist Bacon, who first revived the experimental way of philosophy:
    his mansion-house or manor was at Gorhambury, hard by, where is a
    statue of Henry VIII. and several things worth seeing: it is now the
    seat of my lord Grimstone. Infinite are the antiquities of all sorts
    that have been, and frequently are, dug up at <em>Verolam</em>. When I
    was making an ichnography of it, I could have taken several pecks of
    remainders of Mosaic pavements out of a little ditch near St. German’s
    chapel; and there is one or two intire yet under ground. As you walk
    along the great road that runs north and south through the city from
    St. Michael’s church, you see foundations of houses and streets,
    gutters, floors, &amp;c. under the hedge-rows. The ancient part of the
    monastic church and the steeple are intirely built of Roman brick,
    fetched by the abbots from the old city. March 1718–9 a Mosaic pavement
    was found. The Roman bricks are generally eighteen inches long, twelve
    broad, one and a half thick. I measured one in the south-wall of the
    school-house, by the east end of the abbey church, twenty-three inches
    long, three thick, which probably was made for hypocausts. Upon the
    walls of old <em>Verulam</em> grows the <em>bee orchis</em>, a very curious
    plant. Many are the monuments, brasses, tombs, and inscriptions, in
    the abbey church: the vault of Humphry duke of Glocester was lately
    discovered: the high altar is a curious piece of Gothic work, which I
    have represented in two plates. Hard by is Sopwell nunnery, <span class="sidenote">TAB XXX XXXI.</span>where they
    say Henry VIII. was married to Anna Bolen: part of it is standing.
    But to say any thing particular of religious antiquities, would be
    too tedious: they have lately been working hard at pulling up the old
    foundations of the abbey, and it is now levelled with the pasture, when
    three years ago one might make a tolerable guess at the ichnography
    of the place. In the heart of the town of the adjoining corporation
    stood another of queen Eleanor’s crosses, which they likewise intirely
    demolished, not considering that such kind of antiquities invite many
    curious travellers to come thither. This very year they pulled down
    the stone tower or gate-house on the north side of the abbey, within a
    month after I had taken a sketch of it. In St. Peter’s church I found
    this old inscription on a stone,</p>

  <div class="center"><span class="antiqua">EDITHE : LE : UINETER : GIST : ICI : DIEU : DE<br>
    SA : ALME : EIT : MERCI.</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">I shall add no more, than that my notion of the derivation of this
    town, and several others compounded of like words, is, a fair
    habitation, <em>Vrolân</em>, as it justly merits.</p>

  <p>The Watling-street seems to have passed directly through the Roman
    city, a little southward of St. Michael’s church and St. Mary’s chapel,
    so by St. Stephen’s: nevertheless there is a road round about, without
    the south side of the city-walls, for those that had no occasion to
    go through the city: it goes by St. Julian’s, once an hospital; then
    by Colney-street and Radway; thence almost disused, and scarce known
    but from its straitness: it continues direct, but very narrow, the
    hedges having incroached upon it on both sides, till we arrive at our
    next station, <span class="sidenote smcap">Suellaniacis.</span><em>Suellaniacis</em>, upon Brockley hill, a little south
    of Elstre, and near Stanmore. From this eminence, where Mr. Philpot’s
    summer-house stands, is a sweet prospect across the Thames into Surrey:
    this is by Kendale wood, where formerly they found an old flint wall
    laid in terrace-mortar as they call it, meaning its strength, so hard
    that they could not possibly dig it up with pick-axes: they found
    an oven in the same place. Mr. Philpot, when digging his canal and
    foundations for his buildings, which are upon the site of the old city,
    found many coins, urns, and other antiquities. They have a proverb here,</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0"><i>No heart can think, nor tongue can tell,</i></div>
        <div class="i0"><i>What lies between</i> Brockley-hill <i>and</i> Penny-well;</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">meaning the coins found thereabouts. In the wood over-against the
    house, great quantity of Roman bricks, gold rings, and coins, have been
    found in digging; many arched vaults of brick and flints under the
    trees: the whole top of the hill is covered with foundations. Pennywell
    is a parcel of closes across the valley beyond <em>Suellaniacis</em>,
    where foundations are discernible: here likewise they say was a city:
    two or three years ago they dug privately, in hopes of finding treasure
    at this place. I am of Mr. Baxter’s opinion, that the name of this
    station has some reference to the famous British king <em>Suellan</em>,
    or Cassibelan, general of the Britons against Cæsar, and that his town
    was in this neighbourhood; which I shall consider more particularly
    upon another occasion. By the road side is a barrow lately dug away.</p>

  <p>Hence the road goes through Edgworth; and so at Paddington, by Tyburn,
    it crosses the other Roman road, called now Oxford-street, which was
    originally continued to Old-street, going north of London one way;
    the other way it proceeds by the back side of Kensington, and through
    an unfrequented path, till it falls into the present great road to
    Brentford, Stanes, &amp;c. and it is a Roman road all the way, going pretty
    nearly east and west: therefore our Watling-street must cross it with
    an oblique angle; and by observation I found it to be about forty-five
    degrees. Higden takes notice the Watling-street ran to the west of
    Westminster, over the Thames, so through the middle of Kent: from
    Tyburn I judge it goes over part of Hyde-park,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and by May-fair,
    through St. James’s park, to the street by Old Palace-yard called the
    Wool-staple, to the Thames. Here has been an old gate; one part of
    the arch is still left, but not Roman. On the opposite side of the
    river is Stane-gate ferry, which is the continuation of this street
    to Canterbury, and so to the three famous sea-ports, <em>Rutupiæ</em>,
    <em>Dubris</em>, and <em>Lemanis</em>. This Oxford road was originally
    carried north of London, in order to pass into Essex, because London
    then was not considerable; but in a little time became well nigh
    lost; and Holborn was struck out from it, as conducting travellers
    thither, directly entering the city at Newgate, originally called
    Chamberlain’s gate, and so to Londonstone, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>the <i>lapis milliaris</i>
    from which distances are reckoned: and hence the reason why the name
    of Watling-street is still preserved in the city, though the real
    Watling-street goes through no part of it, but through Southwark; or,
    if we please, we may call this a vicinal branch of the Watling-street.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. LVII.</div>

  <p>According to method I should speak of <em>Londinium</em> here: but
    because the great deal that may be said thereupon will make a discourse
    by itself, we content ourselves at present with giving the plan of
    it, as we suppose it might appear in the times of the Romans; and so
    continuing our tour into Kent, will finish the whole continuation of
    the Watling-street with what few memoirs I could pick up at that time.</p>

  <p>As Old-street went on the north of London, so the proper Watling-street
    we have been upon, since High-cross in Warwickshire, went on the
    south; from Stane-gate ferry across St. George’s fields, so south of
    the Lock hospital to Deptford and Black heath: a small portion of the
    ancient way pointing to Westminster abbey is now the common road on
    this side the nearest turnpike; but the continuation of it is quite
    lost since the bridge was made, and all roads meet at that centre
    as so many <em>radii</em>. When London became considerable, the ferry
    over-against it, from being better attended, rendered that at Stangate
    almost useless; so passengers went through the city by Canon-street,
    Watling-street, and Holborn: hence so little appears of it between
    Tyburn and the Lock hospital; and probably its materials were long
    since wholly dug away to mend the highways. Upon this way in Southwark
    many Roman antiquities have been found, particularly a <em>Janus</em>
    of stone, in possession of Dr. Woodward: but our business shall be to
    prosecute the end of the second journey and the whole third and fourth
    of Antoninus.</p>

  <p>From Shooters hill the direction of the road is very plain both ways: a
    mile westward from the bottom of the hill you find vestiges of it just
    upon the common: some part of the <em>agger</em> is left, made of gravel
    near at hand: from the top of Shooters hill you see it butts upon
    Westminster abbey, where it passes the Thames; and this demonstrates
    its original direction, and that it was begun from the east; for the
    turn of the river at Greenwich intercepts it, though not observed in
    maps: so the way is forced to deflect a little southward there, and
    then recovers its point: beyond that hill it is very strait as far as
    the ken reaches. On Black heath a vast <em>tumulus</em>, now used as a
    butt for <em>archers</em>, hereabouts in great request till Henry the
    <abbr title="8th’s">VIIIth’s</abbr> time: and hence the name of <em>Shooters</em> hill.</p>

  <p>It is to be noted that in the second journey of Antoninus,
    <em>Madviacis</em>, Maidstone, and <em>Durobrovis</em>, Rochester, are
    transposed; therefore in the whole between London and Rochester it is
    twenty-eight miles, as in both the next journeys called twenty-seven,
    (but more rightly the former:) so that, as the Watling-street leads
    directly over Shooters hill between London and Rochester, and seeing
    the whole distance is answerable to fact, we need be in no pain for
    finding out the intermediate station, <span class="sidenote smcap">Noviomagus.</span><em>Noviomagus</em>: doubtless it
    was about Wellend or Crayford,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> as Mr. Somner judges, where the
    respective distances on each side point it out: notwithstanding, as to
    matters of antiquity, we have nothing to say. So with good reason Dr.
    Plot settles <em>Pennocrucium</em> at Stretton in Staffordshire, because
    it is upon this same Watling-street, and answers the distances, though
    no Roman antiquities are there discovered; and the like must we do
    of other places. No doubt there were two stations between London and
    Rochester, though <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>only one mentioned in the Itinerary:
    <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Northfleet.</span> Ro. <i>town</i>.</span>Northfleet
    seems to be the other, where many antiquities are found. I heard much
    talk of an old town at Plumsted, nearer the Thames, and to which
    they say the river came up originally: if true, perhaps this was the
    <em>Noviomagus</em>, and the <em>Trinobantum</em>, or <em>Trenowydh</em> of
    the Britons, i. e. the town of the <em>Novii</em> or <em>Novantes</em>,
    of which their old writers make a din, and would affix it to London:
    they say there are much ruins there. East of Crayford, all along
    upon the heath, as well as on the other side from Shooters hill, the
    ridge of the Watling-street is very visible; but beyond Dartford the
    common road leaves it quite on the south side, which induced me to
    follow the Roman: it becomes a lane presently, and passes in a very
    strait line, for five or six miles, through little valleys, woods, and
    inclosures; and about that distance I lost both it and myself in a wood
    by Southfleet; which obliged me to endeavour again to recover the great
    road: by the quantity of ground I went for that purpose, I guess this
    is a branch of the main road directly to Maidstone, for the convenience
    of such as intended to go strait to <em>Lemanis</em> by <em>Durolenum</em>.
    The soil from London to Dartford is gravel, but the highest ground has
    sand: beyond to Rochester it is chalk full of flints and gravel: the
    flints lie in <em>strata</em>, very black, and squeezed flat like mortar
    in the course of a wall; and above the chalk is pure sand.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Durobrivis.</div>

  <p>The river Medway at Rochester is very broad and rapid, foaming most
    violently: there is a stately bridge built across it: below bridge lie
    about fifty of our biggest first rate men of war unrigged, such as
    the Royal Sovereign, Britannia, Barfleur, &amp;c. The Roman city was very
    strong, being walled about and ditched:<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> near that angle below the
    bridge, <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXX. 2d Vol.</span>incompassed by the river, is a large piece of Roman building
    of the wall, made of rubble-stone laid sloping side-ways, here and
    there Roman bricks: houses are built upon it, and it is broke through
    for a passage; in the inside much flint. Dr. Thorp has great numbers
    of antiquities found hereabouts. This city stands in an angle of the
    river: it seems to have been of a square form, the Watling-street
    running directly through it: most of the walls still remain, but
    repaired. <span class="sidenote">TAB. VI.</span>The castle was built out of one angle by William the
    Conqueror, which together with the cathedral has altered the regular
    ground-plot of the city, as at Lincoln: the walls of the great tower
    now left are four yards thick. The body of the cathedral is of the
    original structure before the Conquest, repaired by bishop Gundulf an
    architect, who likewise built the castle: the great tower is now called
    Gundulf’s tower. The chalky cliff under the castle-wall next the river
    is a romantic sight: the rapidity of the river wastes it away; and then
    huge tracts of the wall fall down: in some places you see the bottom of
    the broad foundation, and which in others is carried down to the water.
    On the north side of the north-west tower of the church is Gundulf’s
    <em>effigies</em>.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The front of the church is of the old work, but a
    new window put in the middle. The eastern gate of the city was pulled
    down not long ago: I saw many of the stones distributed among the
    adjacent buildings, being of a Roman cut.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Vaginacis.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XXXI. XXXII. XXXIII. XXXIV. 2d Vol.</div>

  <p>We must now, according to the Itinerary, leave the Watling-street, and
    go to Maidstone. The road hither passes by that famous British monument
    called Kits-coty-house. It cannot be disputed but that Maidstone is the
    next Roman station. <em>Mædwæg</em> I apprehend signifies the meadows
    upon the river <em>Vaga</em>, which are here beautiful: whether the
    Latin word be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span><em>Madviacis</em>, or <em>Vagniacis</em>, I
    see no difficulty in forming it from the British.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The archbishop
    of Canterbury had a palace here, founded by John Ufford, finished by
    Simon Islip: a college or hospital was erected by A. B. Boniface, and
    a chantry by Thomas Arundel, now the free-school. About 1720, they dug
    up several canoos, made of hollowed trees, in the marshes of the river
    Medway above Maidstone: one is used for a boat to this day. I saw, in
    the hands of Dr. Dodd, a British coin of <em>electrum</em>, found at
    Addington near Malling, anno 1720, in the foundation of a stone wall:
    on the concave side a British horse, rude enough; the convex was plain.</p>

  <p>From thence the Itinerary leads us to <em>Durolenum</em>. The learned
    Talbot first guessed it to be Charing; and to me he seems to be in
    the right. It is upon a spring of the river Len. The present name
    is derived from the British <em>Caer</em>, as they called all Roman
    towns in after-times: anciently it was wrote <em>Cering</em> with a
    Saxon termination, intimating the meadows it stands upon. Roman
    antiquities are found all about, but nothing I have yet met withal,
    that particularly fixes the spot the Roman city stood upon. Near is a
    manor called Broughton; Chart<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> is the name of the hundred, from
    two little adjoining villages: but at this place the distances answer
    well, and the roads in many parts appear: that from hence to Canterbury
    passed by Chilham; so over the river Stour by Sharnford, which retains
    the British name of a causeway. The archbishops of Canterbury had a
    castellated palace at Charing, probably given them by some of the first
    Saxon kings, as a royal demesne of theirs: there are large ruins of
    it still left. Here was a chantry founded by Sir John Burley. All the
    ground upon the river Len at the bottom of the great ridge of hills
    is sand, sometimes exceeding white; between that and the bottom of
    the hills it is flinty: the hills themselves are pure chalk. All Kent
    consists of large tracts of ground gradually rising from the east to a
    western ridge steep that way, so succeeded by another of like manner;
    but any of these tracts are made up of little hills and short valleys,
    quite of a different nature from those on the west side of the island:
    and Mr. Camden has observed this before us, as to the northern part
    of the island, p. 533. <cite>Britannia</cite>. We may gather an idea of
    the natural reason of it from what we spoke at first, of the ground
    hardening upon the instant of the earth’s rotation.</p>

  <p>After we have made this excursion with Antoninus, to take in these
    two stations, which seems to have been done to conduct travellers the
    nearest way to the <em>portus Lemanis</em>, we return again to Rochester,
    that we may finish the progress of the Watling-street.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Feversham.</div>

  <p>From Rochester the Watling-street continues very strait to Canterbury,
    by Feversham, whither I went to visit the remains of the monastery
    founded by king Stephen, and where he was buried with his family. At
    present nothing left but <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXVII.</span>two gate-houses, and they of mean structure:
    the hall was standing intire within this forty year; but now the whole
    monastery is level with the ground, and converted into orchards, so
    that I could not so much as guess at the place where the church was.
    They have a report still, that at the dissolution of abbeys they took
    up the coffin of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>lead wherein the king was buried, and sold it: as
    for his corpse, they threw it into the Thames. Here king Ethelstan
    enacted laws, anno 903. At <span class="sidenote smcap">Newington.</span>Newington seems to have been another
    station: many Roman coins and antiquities have been found <span class="sidenote">Ro. <i>town</i>.</span>there. Vide
    large accounts thereof in Burton’s Itinerary, p. 181. and Casaubon’s
    translation of Antoninus Philos. Beyond Broughton, which seems to have
    been another,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> you come to a very high hill, steep on the west. The
    Watling-street here first presents the tower of the cathedral in its
    line, and both together make a fine show:</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Durovernum.</div>

  <p>Canterbury is deservedly famous for religious as well as Roman
    antiquity, being the place where christianity first made its entrance
    among our Saxon ancestors. Here are many remains of Roman buildings,
    many made of <span class="sidenote">TAB. XCVI.</span>Roman materials in the Saxon times: many antiquities found
    in digging about the hop-grounds; your lordship has quantities of them.
    The city is strongly walled about, and many lunettes or towers at due
    intervals; a deep ditch close underneath, and a great rampart of earth
    within. The original ground-plot here, as in many other cities, is
    spoiled by churches built in the middle of streets. To the south is an
    old obscure gate, called <span class="sidenote">TAB. LIV.</span>Worth gate, partly walled up: it is under the
    castle. This is intirely a Roman work: the semi-circular arch is of
    Roman brick, beautifully turned; the piers of stone; the thickness of
    it is three Roman feet. I suppose this the original gate of the Roman
    city, and from hence went the road which presently divides itself into
    two: the one goes by Chilham to <em>Durolenum</em>, over the river at
    Sharnford, as we said; the other goes in a very strait line, by the
    name of Stone-street, to the port of <em>Lemanis</em>. The castle built
    here in William the Conqueror’s time, extending its limits beyond
    this gate, was the occasion of blocking it up; and so Winchup gate
    was built a little further eastward, to supply its use. The castle is
    much of the same form as that at Rochester, and the walls of the same
    thickness. A little further within the walls is a very high mount,
    called Dungeon hill: a ditch and high bank inclose the <em>area</em>
    before it: it seems to have been part of the old castle. Opposite to it
    without the walls is a hill, seeming to have been raised by the Danes
    when they besieged the city. The top of Dungeon hill is equal to the
    top of the castle, and has a fine prospect over the city and country.
    The materials of the city-walls are chiefly flint. Next to this, where
    the Watling-street comes,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> is Riding-gate, built by a mayor of
    the city, but evidently in the place of the Roman one; for there is
    part of the Roman arch, and the pier of one side, still visible, but
    much lower than the present gate: and in a yard close by is part of
    the arch of a postern, or foot-gate, by the side of it: these arches
    are of Roman brick, and there are in the wall here and there some more
    fragments of the Roman work. The draught of it I have given in the
    plate of the city ground-plot, 96. Hence the Watling-street passes
    directly to Dover, over Barham downs. Next to East-gate is another
    gate, opposite to what they call St. Ethelbert’s tower: this is the way
    to the port of <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXV.</span><em>Rutupium</em>. Here is the famous monastery of St.
    Augustin, the first metropolitan, built, as they say, near the palace
    of the converted king Ethelbert: two gates remain next the city, and
    both very stately: perhaps one belonged to the palace, the other to the
    monastery, which doubtless <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>as magnificent as richly endowed; and
    such its ruins demonstrate, and the great compass of ground it took
    up, incircled with a very high wall. Great vying was ever here between
    the religious of St. Austin and of Tho. à Becket, both very rich and
    contentious. At the west end of this church, as I conjecture, were two
    great towers: half of one is still remaining, called <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXIV.</span>Ethelbert’s tower:
    all the whole stones and pillars about it are skinned off as far as
    they can reach; and every year a buttress, a side of an arch, or the
    like, passes <em>sub hasta</em>. There is part of the other standing,
    if it can be so said, that is only not fallen; I call it <i lang="la">muro
    torto</i>: it is a vast angular piece of the tower, about thirty foot
    high, which has been undermined by digging away a course at bottom,
    in order to be thrown down; but it happened only to disjoint itself
    from the foundation, and leaping, as it were, a little space, lodged
    itself in the ground in that inclining state, to the wonderment of the
    vulgar who do not discern the meaning of it, though the foundation
    it came from is sufficiently visible: thus happening to be equally
    poized, it is a sight somewhat dreadful, and forbids a too near
    approach on any side, with the apprehension of its falling that way.
    Under St. Ethelbert’s tower is the porch where St. Augustin and his six
    successors, as Bede tells us, were interred: the arched roof is left,
    but ready to fall: the pavement is gone, in the middle of which was an
    altar. The adjacent close is full of religious ruins and foundations,
    one great part turned into a stable near the almery: all over they
    are busy in pulling it up, to sell the stones; which generally pays
    the rent, and yet the tenants of such places thrive never the more.
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXV.</span>In one corner of this field are the walls of a chapel, said to have
    been a christian temple before St. Augustin’s time, and reconsecrated
    by him to St. Pancras: a great apple-tree and some plum-trees now
    grow in it: the lower part of it is really old, and mostly made of
    Roman brick, and thicker walls than the superstructure: there is an
    old Roman arch on the south side toward to altar, the top of it about
    as high as one’s nose; so that the ground has been much raised: the
    present east window is a pointed arch, though made of Roman brick,
    later than St. Austin’s time: near it a little room, said to have been
    king Ethelbert’s pagan chapel: however it be, both these and the wall
    adjoining are mostly built of Roman brick: the breadth of the mortar is
    rather more than the brick, and full of pebbles; but the mark of the
    devil’s claws, there observed by the vulgar, is fantastical. The garden
    and orchard adjoining seem to lie in their ancient form: there is a
    large square mount close by the wall, which it equals in height, and
    gives a prospect into the fields. Your lordship has a huge water-pipe
    dug up among many other antiquities in a Roman bath discovered at
    Canterbury: it is five inches and a half diameter at the smaller end,
    seventeen long, seven in diameter at the broad end: they were fastened
    into one another with strong terrace cement. The great number of other
    antiquities of all sorts, found at and about this city, make part of
    your fine collection.</p>

  <p>Eastward of this, and farther out of the city, is the church of
    St. Martin, said to be the christian place of devotion, where king
    Ethelbert’s queen used to go, and St. Austin’s first see: it is built,
    for the most part, of Roman brick: in the middle is a very large
    old-fashioned font, supposed that where the king was baptised. North
    of the city is a very small remnant of St. Gregory’s chapel, founded
    probably by Austin to the honour of his patron.</p>

  <p>The cathedral of Canterbury is very stately, but neither in length,
    breadth, nor height, especially in front, equal to Lincoln, in my
    judgement: it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> intirely vaulted with stone, and of a very pretty
    model of building, but much too high for its breadth, as all Gothic
    buildings were. I believe they got this ill taste from building upon
    the old foundations, the ancient churches being much narrower and lower
    than in the succeeding times: when greater riches flowed in upon them,
    they carried their walls and roofs to an unseemly height. The place
    where Thomas à Becket’s shrine stood, is sufficiently known by the mark
    of the devoted knees quite around it, which have left deep impressions
    in the hard coarse marble. The Black Prince has a noble monument of
    brass: that of Henry IV. is a good tomb, and there is a pretty chapel
    hard by, to say mass for him. There is an old picture of arch-bishop
    Becket’s martyrdom, as called; and upon the wall an old painting of the
    siege of Jerusalem, in our old habits. Here are several monuments of
    the bishops. The metropolitan chair is of grey marble, standing behind
    the high altar: the cloysters are pretty good, and a very large chapel
    near them, called Sermon-house, wainscotted with Irish oak. The reason
    of the ancient name of this British city seems intimated in this verse
    of Virgil,</p>

  <p>Leaving Canterbury,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> I journeyed to find out <em>Rutupiæ</em>. At
    Wingham I saw a very large barrow, of Celtic make, by the road side,
    called the Mount: upon enquiry I found there were several more in
    the parish, and that a lane here is called Port-lane; doubtless the
    Roman road, for here the common road goes more southward. The Roman
    city and port without peradventure was the place now called Stonar,
    or <em>Stanar</em>, as they pronounce it, from the stony foundations I
    chuse to think; over-against Sandwich, or rather half a mile lower upon
    the river coming from Canterbury, and almost incompassed by it. This
    river at first discharged itself into the sea by Ebbesflete, north of
    the Roman city, till the sand, pouring so directly upon it, obliged
    the stream to slide under the cliff by Richborough castle, and so by
    Sandwich: then, coming in obliquely by the weight of its waters, it
    maintains its passage. I conceit the etymology of <em>Rhutupium</em>,
    about which the learned contend much, is to be sought for in this
    <em>Ebbesflete</em>; and that this water was originally called
    <em>Ube</em>, or <em>Tyvi</em>: <em>rhyd tyf</em> or <em>tyvi</em>, is the
    passage over it: the Saxons called it <em>Reptacester</em>, a contraction
    only from <em>Rhutupicester</em>: and so our <em>Ebbe</em> at present came
    from them; <em>Ruptimuth</em> anciently. Hence you see far into the isle
    of Thanet and Ramsgate cliff, named from the Romans, thrusting its
    chalky promontory into the sea. This was the chief port for the Roman
    navy.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> At present there is only a farm-house or two, standing on
    an elevation in the marshes: they informed me that here had been a
    great city, and that they can discover all the streets when the corn
    is on the ground; and those streets are nothing but pure gravel laid
    very deep: innumerable stones and foundations have been dug up, but now
    mostly evacuated; and no doubt Sandwich was built out of it. The river
    runs close by it, with difficulty preserving its current to the sea;
    but no doubt originally it was an open beach, or port: perhaps the city
    itself was an island. The old mouth of the river is now filled up by
    the astonishing quantity of small pebbles thrown into this bay by the
    roll of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>the ocean: you see here a hundred acres of this flat
    ground covered over with them six or seven foot deep, and looking blue
    like the water. I fancied the people that lived here, in like danger
    with those that travel the sandy deserts of Africa, or Arabia. Here
    are two elevations, where they say two churches stood: upon one, where
    an elder-tree grows, much rubble and stone is left, but no part of any
    building; nor is it easy to distinguish what it was originally.</p>

  <p class="noindent">It is a most noble remnant of Roman antiquity, where in later times
    of their empire the <em>Legio</em> II. <em>Aug.</em> was quartered: the
    walls on three sides are pretty intire, and in some places still about
    twenty-five or thirty foot high, without any ditch: the side next the
    sea being upon a kind of cliff, the top of the wall is but level with
    the ground: beside, at the east angle the wall descends to another
    slope just upon the river, which seems to have been in the nature of an
    outwork, or gradual ascent into the castle: the ground on the inside
    is pretty much raised. In the middle of the north-east side there is
    a square work jutting out from the wall, which seems to have been an
    oblique<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> gate to enter at, for those that came from the water side;
    and it is not unlikely that gap on the north-west side was another
    gate: it was a square CV. paces one way, CL. the other; according
    to the Roman method of making camps, a third part longer than their
    breadth. There is a foundation within, which has caused many words
    among the Kentish antiquaries; seems to have been a <em>Pharos</em>,
    or lodging for the commanding officer, a <em>prætorium</em>: there are
    foundations of several apartments, the walls monstrously thick and
    strong. It is manifest to any one that seriously contemplates the ruins
    of the walls in divers places, that this castle was destroyed by great
    violence and industriously; I guess, by the Saxons immediately after
    the Romans left the island, when they could more boldly make descénts
    upon the coast: the reason why, is evident from the intent of these
    castles: upon the eastern corner, especially, great piles of wall lie
    one upon another like rocks: in other places cavities are hewn out of
    its thickness, that would make good lodging-rooms: the manner of the
    composition of the walls is seven courses of small hewn stone, which
    take up four Roman feet: then two courses of Roman brick, which are
    white, like the brick in the isle of Ely. I observe all the brick
    about Sandwich to be of the same colour, made of whitish clay. The
    walls are twelve foot thick: the inward body thereof is made of flint
    and excessive hard mortar. Sandwich bears directly south. Dr. Holland
    talks of a carved head over one of the gates; but I could find no such
    thing now. In the way thither, upon an eminence is the carcass of a
    castrensian <span class="sidenote smcap">Amphitheatre</span>amphitheatre made of turf; I suppose, for the exercise
    and diversion of the garrison: the soil of it is gravel and sand, and
    has been long ploughed over,<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXVI. 2d Vol.</span> that we need not wonder it is so level.
    There are three Roman <em>tumuli</em> before Sandwich west <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>gate; one a
    windmill stands on: it is not easy to assign which Contentus was buried
    under:</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>South of Sandwich, as we go along upon the sea-shore, are six large and
    broad Celtic <em>tumuli</em>, equidistant: the second from the town has
    been dug away, to raise a little fort upon the road: they all stand in
    a line east and west.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> This flat coast is fenced against the ocean
    by the sand-downs, which in Lincolnshire we call <em>meals</em>: but
    within the memory of man, as they told me, the sea has commenced a new
    method of guarding against its own violence, by covering the shore, for
    a great depth and height, with the pebbles afore mentioned; which is an
    odd mutation in nature; and it is observable that these pebbles come
    from the south. I rode from Sandwich as far as Hithe, upon the brink
    of the shore or cliff, in sight of France all the way; and nothing
    could be more entertaining in this autumnal season, when the weather is
    generally clear, serene and calm. Much sea <em>tithymal</em> grows here,
    and a very pretty plant, <i lang="la">papaver cornutum flore luteo</i>, rock
    samphire feeding upon <em>petroleum</em>, a most excellent pickle, and
    many more.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The murmur of the ocean has a noble solemnity in it, as
    Homer says, when latinised,</p>

  <p class="noindent">which is an exact idea of this place. By listening attentively I
    observed this noise of the ocean is by fits, at short but equal
    intervals; which I believe gave occasion to that fancy of the ancients,
    that every tenth wave was the largest; of which Ovid has a distich.</p>

  <p>Sandown castle is composed of four lunettes of very thick arched
    work of stone, with many port-holes for great guns: in the middle
    is a great round tower, with a cistern at top; underneath an arched
    cavern, bomb-proof: a foss incompasses the whole, to which there is
    a passage over a draw-bridge. Deal castle and Walmer castle are of
    the same nature, all built by Harry VIII. to guard this naked level
    coast: moreover, lines are drawn along between castle and castle, and
    at proper intervals round bastions with a ditch and parapet of earth,
    where cannon may be planted, as in the infancy of fortification. These
    are what Camden calls <em>Rome’s works</em>, and fancies to be remnants
    of Cæsar’s ship-camp: the neighbours with as little truth affirm they
    were thrown up by Oliver Cromwell, for reduction of these <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>castles:
    one is close by the north side of Deal, and two between Deal castle and
    Walmer castle. At Walmer castle the cliff begins for about half a mile
    southward with a gentle rise to a hill, whereon is a <em>tumulus</em>:
    then the shore is plain again in a valley till you come to Kings-wold,
    which is half a mile’s space. <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXVII. 2nd Vol.</span>Between Walmer castle and Deal I take to
    be the spot where Cæsar landed in his first expedition, because it is
    the first place where the shore can be ascended north of Dover, and
    exactly answers his assigned distance of eight miles: probably in his
    second expedition, when he came with many more ships, and had a perfect
    knowledge of the country, he went a little farther in the downs,
    whereabouts now is Deal, a town lately sprung up from the mariners. As
    for his sea-camps, it is vain to expect a sight of them; they are many
    ages since absorpt by the ocean, which has so long been exercising its
    power, and wasting the land away. Even since Harry the VIIIth’s time it
    has carried off the sea-ward <em>esplanades</em> of the three castles,
    and one half of two of the three circular forts. Indeed, of late years,
    the providential ejectment of those pebbles has put a stop to it in
    some measure; and it is amazing to see how it by degrees fills up these
    fosses and trenches, and sometimes flies over the banks a good way up
    into the land, with a power well expressed by the poet,</p>

  <p class="noindent">But of this affair of Cæsar’s I reserve to myself another opportunity

  <p>Now my journey lay intirely upon the edge of the cliffs, whose
    precipicious height, with the noble prospect at sea, and most awful
    roaring of the waves, filled the mind with a sense of Nature’s majesty.
    About St. Margaret’s on cliff, near the light-houses, I saw in two
    places a great number of little <em>tumuli</em>, of unequal bulk, close
    by one another; and the like I found frequently about Barham downs,
    and between Hardres<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and Chilham, and other places. I know not
    that such have ever been taken notice of: the people say they were
    burying-places of the Danes; probably digging into them might give us
    some satisfaction. I believe them Celtic, because I saw many sorts of
    them, and such as appear on Salisbury plain.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dubris Portus.</span></div>

  <p>Dover is a most romantic situation: it is a great valley, and the only
    one about this coast where water is admitted inwards of the cliff, here
    very high; and a running brook discharges itself into the sea:<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> the
    water formerly came a good way higher up, and made a large port; and
    they have found anchors above the town. <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXVIII. 2nd Vol.</span>The Roman city of <em>Dubris</em>
    was to the south of the river: the Watling-street enters it at Bigin
    gate, coming very strait from Canterbury over Barham down, where it
    is very perfect:<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> butting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> directly upon the great tower of the
    cathedral, it bears a little more northerly than north-west. This city
    was an oblong square, and some of the walls are left: the churches
    are of a very antique make: that of St. Martin is collegiate, founded
    by Wightred king of Kent; it is a venerable ruin: the east end seems
    to have terminated in three semi-circular works: it was built in
    form of a cross, as to its main body. Much remains of the priory,
    now a farm-house. The <em>maison dieu</em> over-against it is become a
    store-house: here the knights Hospitallers or Templars lodged, coming
    into, or going out of, the kingdom. The piers that form the haven, or
    large bason, are costly and great works: above is a fort with four
    bastions of modern date. The broad beach which lies at the mouth
    of this great valley, and was the harbour in Cæsar’s time, is very
    delightful: it is no little part of the diversion, in walking there,
    to observe the odd produce of the ocean thrown up under your feet, and
    the sea-plants that grow there; the<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXIX. XL. 2d Vol.</span> <em>umbelli</em>, <em>star-fishes</em>,
    many curious fossils and shells; the <em>eringo</em>, <em>sea-lungs</em>,
    <em>sea-weed</em>, or <em>ood</em> as called, &amp;c. One long street here
    is named Snare-gate, from the most tremendous rocks of chalk hanging
    directly over the houses; as Cnarsborough in Yorkshire, says Mr.
    Camden, p. 715.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dover Castle.</span></div>

  <p>The castle is the strongest place in the world, of old fortification;
    it takes up thirty acres of ground: it is an amazing <em>congeries</em>
    of walls, ditches, arches, embattlements, mounts, and all imaginable
    contrivances to render it impregnable after the old mode: but with
    highest regret I beheld this most noble and memorable fortress, once
    thought the key of Britain, and that has divers times had the honour to
    save the kingdom from conquest and slavery, now become a common prey
    to the people that belong to it: in the late wars with France they
    kept 1500 prisoners in the great castle; but within this twelvemonth
    they have carried away the timbers and floors, disabling it even for
    that use. Thus much I think out of gratitude is its due; let it stand
    a monument of antiquity, or sink slowly by its own ruin. The brass gun
    called Queen Elizabeth’s Pocket-pistol is a great curiosity, twenty-two
    foot long: it requires fifteen pound of powder, and carries a ball
    seven miles (as the gunner told me;) it is excellently well wrought. I
    saw two very old keys, and a brass horn, which seem to be the ensigns
    of authority belonging to the constable of the castle, or lord warden
    of the cinque ports. One part of the fortifications consists of a large
    circular work, in which stands the old church, said to have been built
    by Lucius, an ancient king of the Britons, and first christian. Bishop
    Stillingfleet thinks he is no romantic person, but reigned in Kent and
    Sussex: however that be, I believe this church is as ancient as the
    time assigned him. There is not much doubt to be made, that upon this
    hill was a <em>castrum</em> of the Romans, like that at Richborough, to
    guard this haven. It is somewhat surprizing that our Saxon ancestors
    should take great pains to demolish Roman works, though they wanted
    such in the same places, and were forced to build them again. I look
    upon it as an argument that they had no thoughts of conquering the
    island at first, and destroyed these bulwarks, that such might not
    hinder their depredations; but espying the nakedness of the land,
    thoroughly evacuated of its youth and men of arms by the Romans, they
    found a conquest practicable: then were they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>obliged to
    repair these castles. The church we are speaking of was built, in the
    first times of christianity, out of part of the Roman ruins, whence
    there are huge quantities of Roman bricks laid into the work: the
    arches are intirely turned with them; the corners and many parts, both
    within and without, are built up therewith; and the remainder is of
    stone originally cut by the Romans: it is in form of a cross, and has
    a square tower in the middle. I have represented the drawing of it in
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLVIII.</span><a href="#i_129_1">plate 48</a>. The stone windows of this church are of later date than the
    building; they have been put in long since: but the greatest curiosity
    here is the <span class="sidenote"><i>Roman.</i> <span class="smcap">Pharos.</span></span><em>Pharos</em>, or Roman watch-tower, standing at the west
    end of the church: notwithstanding it is so much disfigured by new
    daubing with mortar, casing and mending, I discovered its primary
    intention the first minute I saw it; and sent the three prints of
    it, which I here present the reader, to monsieur Montfaucon, at the
    instances of my most honoured lord, the archbishop of Canterbury. I was
    in hopes they would have been more useful to that celebrated author;
    for therein at least he might have found, that the building which he
    first took for a <em>Pharos</em>, and whereof he gives us four views, is
    only the tower of the church we were talking of. The description of
    this curious work, which I believe the most perfect of any left, in
    short is thus.</p>

  <p class="clear"><span class="sidenote">TAB. XLVII.</span>In the <a href="#i_129_2">47th plate</a> we have shown the ground-plot upon which it is
    formed, and a section of the work; whence we may readily observe that
    the design is simple, but admirably contrived for its use and purpose:
    the base is octagonal without, within a square; but the sides of the
    square and octagon are equal, viz. fifteen Roman feet, which reduces
    the wall to the thickness of ten feet. In this manner it was carried
    up to the top, which was much higher than at present; but it retires
    inward continually from all sides, with much the same proportion as
    an Egyptian <em>obelus</em>. Upon four of these sides there are windows
    narrow, handsomely turned with a semi-circular arch of Roman brick six
    foot high, so that the outside of it appears as in our <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLVI.</span><a href="#i_129_3">46th plate</a>. The
    door to it is on the east side, about six foot wide, very well turned
    over head, with an arch made of a course of Roman brick and stone
    alternately, fourteen foot high. All the stones of this work are of
    a narrow scantling; and the manner of the composure, throughout, is
    perfectly the same with that lately described at Richborough castle:
    there are first two courses of this brick, which is level with the
    bottom of the windows; then seven courses of hewn stone, which mount up
    to the top of the windows; then two courses of brick, seven of stone
    alternately, to the top; every window by this means reaching to a stage
    or story. There are five of these stages left: the windows are visible
    enough to a discerning eye, though some be stopt up, others covered
    over, others have modern church-like windows of stone put in. I suppose
    the inside was intirely filled up with a stair-case: the height of what
    is left is forty foot; I believe there was twenty foot more originally;
    and the whole number of windows on a side was eight. This building
    was made use of as a steeple, and had a pleasant ring of bells in it,
    which Sir George Rook procured to be carried away to Portsmouth. Since
    then the office of the ordnance, under pretext of savingness, have
    taken away the lead that covered it, and left this rare piece of art
    and masonry to struggle with the sea, air and weather. Mr. Degg gave
    me a coin of Dioclesian, found here. The Erpinghams arms are patched
    up against one side of the <em>Pharos</em>, being two bars and a canton;
    so that I suppose it was repaired in Henry the Fifth’s time, lord
    Erpingham then warden of Dover castle. In the Roman castle here the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
    Tungrican soldiers had their station. I have heard there is another
    such <em>Pharos</em> at St. Andrew’s in Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

  <p>On the other high cliff opposite to this, beyond the town, has been
    another <em>Pharos</em>: some part of the bottom part of it is still
    left, called The Devil’s Drop, from the strength of the mortar: others
    call it Bredonstone. Here the new constable of the castle is sworn.
    If we consider the ancient state of Dover, we must imagine that the
    little river ran directly into the sea, and left a harbour close to the
    walls of the town; but in process of time, as the sea threw up that
    vast beach which lies between the town and it, the river was forced by
    an oblique passage to creep along the shore under the southern cliff,
    and there vent itself where now is the harbour. This is what Nature
    practises in the microcosm in innumerable instances, as the passage
    of the gall and pancreatic juice into the intestines, in the duct of
    the urine from the ureters into the bladder, of the chyle into the
    torrent of the blood, insinuating themselves for some space between
    the membranes. And this caution may be of service in forming harbours;
    as in that costly work of the French king’s before Dunkirk, where two
    banks or piers projected for half a mile through the sands directly,
    which ought rather to have gone downwards a little towards the fall of
    the tide. The cliffs here are of solid chalk to the very bottom, full
    of the blackest flints; and those at Calais seem perfectly like them;
    and no doubt a long vein of chalk is continued from one to the other
    under the sea, and perhaps through many countries: but that these two
    places were ever contiguous, or joined by an isthmus, is chimerical.</p>

  <p>Though the mariners have much mathematics on board, and in all their
    tackle and machinery, yet here I had occasion of observing a gross
    error, that has not been thought on, in the shape of their oars; where
    the extremity of that fan-like part, which opposes the water in rowing,
    is broadest. Now this is quite contrary to Nature’s method, who is the
    best geometrician in like cases: in the shape of a single feather,
    or in the wings of birds, the extremity is always pointed, and the
    broadest part is nearest the joint where the power lies, analogous to
    the <em>fulcrum</em> of leavers; therefore is drawn off to a narrower
    scantling, as the part recedes from it, and the effect of the moving
    force: thus it is even in the wings of butterflies, and all other
    insects, as well as birds; and so in the water-beetles that row with
    oars. Though the broad part resists the water more as farther distant
    from the <em>fulcrum</em>, yet it requires more proportionable strength;
    and in my judgment, therefore, oars ought to be made quite the contrary
    way, and drawn off into a point, the broadest part nearest the hand;
    and I doubt not but equal strength will then out-row the other,
    <i lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

  <p>Beyond Dover southward the cliff is exceedingly high to Folkstone.
    In the road two great Roman barrows, which will be eaten away in a
    few years by the sea. Here this larger track of cliff ends, as to the
    ocean, and slaunts off westward towards Wye in a long ledge very steep
    all the way to the west. The whole county of Kent consists of three
    or four of these parcels, lying parallel, and running nearly north
    and south: they rise gently from the east as a reclining plain, and
    then end suddenly on the western side with a quick descent: at bottom
    begins another such plain, and it ends in like manner after it has
    gone its proper distance, to be alike succeeded, as we said before.
    Beyond this we are upon, southward is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>a lesser ledge of high ground
    sandy and rocky, but good land, especially in the valleys, and full
    of wood. This is terminated by Romney marsh, such another country as
    our Lincolnshire Holland. To the right of us is Eleham, seated in a
    pleasant concavity: there has been a religious house. Upon one end of
    our upper chalk-hills, near Folkstone, is a camp called Castle hill.</p>

  <p>Now descending, Folkstone<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> offers itself, still standing on a
    cliff, but not so high as the former, and of a rocky composure,
    the other being chalk: it was anciently called <em>Flostane</em>, a
    lesser rock, or cliff of stone; so that it probably was the <span class="sidenote">TAB. XCVIII.</span><i lang="la">lapis
    tituli</i> of the Romans. Here is a copious spring runs through the
    town. Near the church, upon the sea side, is a square plain, like that
    I observed at Burgh in Lincolnshire, and was of the same use. I saw two
    pieces of old wall hanging over the terrible cliff, seemingly of Roman
    work: here are some old guns, one of iron of a very odd cast, no doubt
    as old as Henry the Eighth’s time. Many Roman coins have been found
    here. A nunnery was built by Eanswide, a religious daughter of Eadbald
    king of Kent.</p>

  <p>I passed by Sandgate castle, another of those built by Henry VIII.
    in a little valley where the shore is plain: then we enter upon the
    beach. Here are many springs which come down from the higher ground,
    and sink immediately into this beach, rendering it a little boggy: this
    I thought very odd. You ride through a wood of sea-poppy, which is a
    fine variety in nature, casting all the numerous seeds into a long
    pod, instead of the common globular head: the leaves look hoary, like
    sea-ragwort, and are finely crisped; the flowers of a most delicate
    yellow, taken notice of by the poet,</p>

  <p>Hythe<span class="sidenote smcap">Hythe.</span> stands on the edge of this lesser ridge, but the marsh has
    intercepted it from the sea. They talk much of their charnel-house full
    of human bones, said to have been the massacred Danes; but I thought it
    not worth going to see, nor believed their report of it. They say this
    has been a great city, and reached as far as West Hythe, where is an
    old ruinous chapel: they mean undoubtedly the city of <em>Lemanis</em>.
    Here were two hospitals, St. Bartholomew’s, and St. Leonard’s.</p>

  <p>I visited Saltwood castle, in hopes to find somewhat Roman, as is
    reported: it is a very strong seat of the archbishop’s: the outer wall
    has towers and battlements, and a deep ditch: within, and on one side,
    stands the main body of the place: two great and high towers at the
    gate of this, over which are the founder’s arms, archbishop Courtney,
    in two escutcheons; the first impaled with those of the see; the other
    plain, a label over three plates. This inner work has a stronger and
    higher wall, with a broad embattled parapet at top: within is a court,
    but the lodgings are all demolished: the floor of the ruinous chapel is
    strongly vaulted: in the middle of the court is a large square well,
    which is the only thing I saw that looked like Roman. It is said that
    hereabouts anchors are dug up; which, if true, is not owing to the
    sea’s coming so high, as the vulgar think, for that is impossible; but
    to an iron forge of the Romans, conveniently placed, where so much wood
    grows, so near the sea, and so many ports. They say too that Roman
    coins are found at Newington, not far off here.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Lemanis</span> Portus.</div>

  <p>A little way further, at the end of the Stane-street,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the Roman
    road from Canterbury; and at a proper distance from thence is the port
    of <em>Lemanis</em>.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XCIX.</span> I am surprized that some Kentish antiquaries should,
    by pretended corrections of the Itinerary, send it farther off to the
    southern coasts. As soon as I came to Limne church, looking from the
    brow of the hill to the subjacent marshes, I descried the tattered
    Roman walls, situate on this southern decline, almost at the bottom.
    One would imagine the name came from the <em>Stone-street</em>; for such
    it literally signifies, <i lang="la">via lapidea</i>: this is a solid rock of
    stone laid out in a strait line between here and Canterbury. Thus in
    Yorkshire another Roman road is called <em>Leming-lane</em>, from its
    stony composure. <em>Lhe</em> signifies a way in British; <em>maen</em>,
    a stone. Its present appellation of <em>Studfal</em> castle gives
    occasion to some uncouth etymologies: without any difficulty I think
    it derived from <em>stæd-weall</em>, the sea-shore, in Saxon; so that
    it signifies no more than <i lang="la">castrum littoreum</i>. This fine remnant
    of Roman work, and which was the garrison of the Turnacensian band,
    hangs as it were upon the side of the hill; for it is pretty steep
    in descent: the walls include about twelve acres of ground, in form
    somewhat squarish, without any ditch: a pretty brook, arising from
    the rock west of the church, runs for some space on the east side of
    the wall; then passes through it, and so along its lowermost edge by
    the farm-house at bottom. The composition of the wall is similar to
    that of Richborough; but instead of hewn stone and regular courses, as
    there, the interval between the three layers of Roman brick is made of
    rag-stone: the brick too is of the same whitish kind, but remarkably
    thin. I suppose the clay shrank much in burning. This interval of stone
    is four feet of Roman standard: the walls are twelve foot thick, and
    have some round holes at equal spaces, that run quite through, as we
    observed at <em>Sorbiodunum</em> and <em>Verolanium</em> perhaps to let
    the air in for drying the wall, being of so great a thickness. Here
    are several of the circular, or rather elliptic buttments, as thick as
    the wall, like those at the castle of <em>Garionenum</em>, near Yarmouth
    in Norfolk, in <span class="sidenote">TAB. LVIII.</span><a href="#i_132_2">plate 58</a>. which my worthy and learned friend Mr. Hare
    gave me from his own mensuration. It is a piece of masonry, I must own,
    unaccountable to me: they are like round towers or bastions, but solid;
    and some scarce join to the wall at the sides, but go quite through
    to the inside. The circuit of this wall is manifest enough on three
    sides, but that southward is levelled to the ground: every where else,
    where not standing, it lies sideways, flat, close by, in prodigious
    parcels; or where standing, cracked through the whole solid thickness,
    as if Time was in a merry humour, and ruined it in sport: but I believe
    it is the effect of design and much labour, as I said of Richborough:
    probably the Saxons or Danes thus dismantled it, to render it useless
    against their incursions. Where this wall is standing, it is ten foot
    high or more, made with excellent cement: on the eastern side is such
    another gate, formed by the return of the wall, as at the place last
    mentioned. Geo. Hunt, an old man, living in the farm-house, told me
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>he has found coins here: he says, once the sea-bank broke, and
    his house with all the adjacent marshes was floated: for the level of
    the ocean is higher than this place; but it has fenced itself out by
    raising the ground continually near the shore, as it does in other
    like marshes. Whether the sea reached this lower wall, even in the
    time of the Romans, I cannot determine; for I do not believe this was
    the very port, but the castle belonging to it: that, I rather think,
    was somewhat more eastward, about West Hithe; and there, the town
    that belonged to it: for they find old foundations frequently under
    the side of the hill, laid in strong terrace mortar. The rev. Mr.
    Bagnal, minister of the place, informs me, that the field, of about
    sixteen acres of ground, adjoining to the church-yard of Limne, is to
    this day called the Northern town: nor do they know that it ever had
    any other name; which intimates that the Roman town was thereabouts,
    lying upon the slope of the hill, as the castle does, and to the east
    of it. This port is now called Ship-way, where the <em>limenarcha</em>,
    or lord warden of the cinque ports, was anciently sworn; where their
    courts were kept, and all the pleas relating to these ports: since the
    decay thereof, that ceremony is transferred to Dover. This Ship-way too
    denominates the <em>lathe</em>, or division of the country. Leland says,
    the people of Limne had an horn and mace, remaining ensigns of their
    authority.</p>

  <p>Thus have we conducted our journey, for the space of 500 miles, all
    upon Roman roads, to these three famous ports on the eastern shore,
    where commonly the great Roman emperors and generals landed from the
    continent; and in which we have run over such notices as occurred to us
    in thirty-five Roman stations, many camps, and other things of highest
    antiquity. The season of the year for expeditions being far spent, it
    is time to release your lordship’s patience, and retire into harbour,
    concluding with the great Roman wit, in his poetical voyage,</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">I Have sometimes in travelling been apt, within my own mind, to make a
    comparison between the excellence of the study of Philosophy, and that
    commonly called Antiquity, that is, ancient history. The beauties and
    the advantage of natural inquiries I cannot but be highly sensible of;
    yet I must needs give the preference to the latter, as it more nearly
    concerns the rational part of the creation, for whom the whole was
    made: it is a comment upon the wonderful volumes of divine wisdom, and
    the conduct of providence in the management of its supreme workmanship.
    God has given us indeed a large manuscript of his power, and other
    adorable attributes, in his wide-extended products, the furniture of
    the world; but in man, a more correct epitome of himself; a delegated
    immaterial particle of his spirituality, a self-moving principle of
    free agency, from the very fountain of all existence. As he is the
    great master-wheel and <i lang="la">primum movens</i>; so we are the subordinate
    executors of his mighty purposes, by his direction and superintendence
    carrying on the regular government and unseen operations thereof.
    Whoever declaims against this, ought to be looked upon as one of a
    poor, narrow way of thinking, and who does not deserve so much as that
    noble faculty of the soul, reminiscence or memory, which is the same
    to a single man, as ancient history is to the whole community: such a
    one no more claims the name of a scholar, than he that knows but the
    letters of the Alphabet, or whose study consists only in Gazettes. It
    is the knowledge of antiquity that can give us a maturity in judgement,
    either in persons or things; and how unfit such a one is, that is
    destitute of it, in the executing the great offices of life, I need not
    inculcate.</p>

  <p>But nothing I can say in favour of this subject, can be so great a
    panegyric to it, as your lordship’s illustrious name prefixed. The
    glorious ardour for this kind of learning, that kindled in your
    younger years, and that through a long cultivation of it has produced
    a boundless extent of knowledge, with the deepest penetration, the
    strongest judgement, the fire of the soul, and all sublimest qualities
    which the world admires in your lordship; bears down all opposition to
    the study of antiquities, wherein you preside most worthily; wherein no
    one dares to be rival, or hopes to be equal. We see the fruits of it in
    the best-chosen library of ancient authors, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> the best collection of
    most ancient coins, statues, busto’s, and learned marbles, which the
    world can show. You, my lord, by treading in the steps of the great
    Arundel, have brought old arts, Greece and Rome, nay Apollo and all his
    Muses, to Great Britain: Wilton is become tramontane Italy.</p>

  <p>Every part of learning is your lordship’s province, and sure of your
    protection. But I have a particular happiness in laying before you
    the following account of this summer’s journey, because the greatest
    part of it was by your own direction, and as excursions I made whilst
    at your lordship’s most delightful seat at Wilton. I shall begin with
    what I observed in my tour about it, and proceed to my more western
    perambulation through a country pregnant of antiquities, and the
    greatest curiosities in the world.</p>

  <p>The <em>Belgæ</em>, the ancient inhabitants of this country, were a brave
    and warlike people, when on their original continent; and we have no
    reason to think, after transplantation on the British soil, they abated
    aught of their courage and valour, natural to its inhabitants. These
    were one of those powerful nations, whose conquest gave opportunity
    to the emperor Vespasian highly to signalize his conduct when he
    first made a figure in arms. Hence it is that we find so many camps
    hereabouts, from the sea side to the midland parts; many of which were
    made by him, and others by his undaunted opposers. The road from Wilton
    to Shaftesbury, called the Ten-mile Course, is a fine ridge of downs,
    continued upon the southern bank of the river Nader, with a sweet
    prospect to the right and left, all the way, over the towns and the
    country on both sides: a traveller is highly indebted to your lordship
    for adding to his pleasure and advantage, in reviving the Roman method
    of placing a numbered stone at every mile, and the living index of a
    tree to make it more observable; which ought to be recommended as a
    laudable pattern to others: thus C. Gracchus planted a stone at every
    mile, with the distance inscribed, says Plutarch; and thus Rutilius,
    Itinerar. II.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Between N<sup>o</sup> 5. and 6. is a pretty large camp, called<span class="sidenote smcap">Chiselbury.</span> Chiselbury, upon
    the northern brow of the hill: it is single ditched and of a roundish
    form: before the chief entrance is an half-moon, with two apertures
    for greater security: there is a ditch indeed goes from it downward
    to the valley on both sides, but not to be regarded. This I imagine
    relates not to the camp; for I observed the like across the same road
    in many places between little declivities, and seem to be boundaries
    and sheep-walks made since, and belonging to particular parishes. I
    fancy this name imparted from some shepherd’s cot, anciently standing
    hereabouts, in Saxon <em>Ccsol</em>. It seems to be a Roman camp, but
    of later date. At the end of this course, when you come to the great
    chalk-hill looking towards Shaftesbury, are three or four Celtic
    barrows, one long and large, pointing east and west: in this hill is a
    quarry of stone, very full of sea-shells. Not far off, in the parish
    of Tisbury, near Warder castle, is a great intrenchment in a wood,
    which was probably a <span class="sidenote">Br. <i>oppidum</i>.</span>British <em>oppidum</em>, and near the river before
    mentioned.</p>

  <p>Returning, we see upon the highest eminence that overlooks Wilton,
    and the fertile valley at the union of the Nader and Willy, the
    famous King-barrow, as vulgarly called: it is a round <span class="sidenote">Carvilii <i>tumulus</i>.</span><em>tumulus</em>,
    of a most ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> form, flat at top, and without any ditch. Your
    lordship rightly judges it in situation to be one of the highest
    barrows in England, being, by exact observation from the water-level
    and calculation, at least four hundred foot above the surface of the
    ocean. This, questionless, is a Celtic <em>tumulus</em>: and the very
    name, inherent through long revolutions of time, indicates it to be
    the grave of a king of this country of the <em>Belgæ</em>, and that
    Wilton was his royal residence, which for goodness of air, of water
    and soil, joined with the most delightful downs all around it, must
    highly magnify his judgement in choice of a place second to none for
    all the conveniences and delicacies of life. If we reflect a little
    upon the matter, it appears a supposition far from improbability,
    that this is the very monument of Carvilius mentioned by Cæsar, who,
    joining with the other kings along the country on the sea-side from
    hence to Kent, attacked his sea-camp on the Rutupian shore: and this
    was to make a diversion to the great Roman general, pressing hard upon
    Cassibelan; for, as the late learned and sagacious Mr. Baxter observes
    in his Glossary, where should <em>Carvilius</em> live, but among the
    <em>Carvilii</em>? as <em>Segonax</em>, one of his confederates, among the
    <em>Segontiaci</em>; that is, <em>Segontium</em>, or <em>Caersegont</em>,
    as the Britons call it; which is now Silchester. And it seems to
    have been the fashion of that time for kings to be denominated from
    the people or place they governed; as <em>Cassibelan</em> was in name
    and fact king of the <em>Cassii</em>; and many other instances I might
    bring of like nature. Where then should <em>Carvilius</em> live, but
    at <em>Carvilium</em>, now Wilton; or where be buried, but in the most
    conspicuous place near his palace? and no other barrow competitor to
    leave any doubt or scruple. It is natural to suppose that the very spot
    where his residence was, is the same where king Edgar’s queen spent
    the latter part of her life in a religious house she built near your
    lordship’s seat, being a hard dry soil, gravelly, and incompassed with
    two fine rivers, which in early times added much to the security of
    the place, and much sought for by the Britons. We took notice, when
    with particular pleasure we visited his <em>tumulus</em>, and paid our
    respects to the illustrious <em>manes</em> of the royal defunct, that,
    among other views of great distance, we could see Long-barrow beyond
    Stonehenge, and all the long ridge of Martinsal hill, St. Ann’s hill,
    and Runwayhill beyond that; upon which goes the great Wansdike, which I
    take to be the northern boundary of the Belgic kingdom. I question not
    but one purpose of this interment was to be in sight of the holy work,
    or temple, of Stonehenge. Here then may we conclude rest the ashes of
    Carvilius, made immortal by Caæsar for bravely defending his country;
    now resting in the possessions of a successor, master of both their
    great qualities; who, when wielding the British trident, in a fleet
    infinitely superior to Cæsar’s, could assert a more universal empire.
    In you, my lord, the memory of Carvilius flourishes again, in your
    eminent love for your country’s honour, and in your care for preserving
    his monument, and adorning it with fresh verdure; by planting four
    trees round its edge,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and introducing it as a <em>terminus</em>, in
    one of the visto’s, to the admirable equestrian statue of M. Aurelius,
    in the middle of the principal star of your park. Thus, according to
    ancient usage, was the <em>tumulus</em> of Diomedes planted with the
    <em>platanus</em> brought from Asia for that purpose; as Pliny informs us
    in book XII. cap. <span class="allsmcap">i</span>.</p>

  <p>From hence riding along the hare-warren and end of the park, we are
    entertained with the landscape of no less than five rivers, four
    retaining the old British names: the villages on each side of them are
    so thick, that they seem to join and form long cities in woods. About
    the union of these rivers are three cities and three cathedrals within
    a triangle, whose sides are less than three miles; Wilton, Old and New
    Sarum. The <em>Nadre</em> signifies a snake or adder, metaphorically
    drawn from its winding current: it rises by the end of the Ten-mile
    course above described, and passes by a pleasant village belonging
    to your lordship, Chilmark, famous for its quarries; of a very good
    stone, white, and that rises in any dimensions: there is now a single
    stone, lying over the mouth of the quarry like an architrave, full
    sixty foot long, twelve foot thick, and, as the workmen have assured
    me upon examination, perfectly without flaw: sometimes here are found
    great petrified oyster-shells. The Willy rises about Warminster,
    taking in a little brook, the Dyver, passing under ground, runs by
    <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Yarnbury.</span> Ro. <i>camp</i>.</span>Yarnbury, a vast Roman camp, where some think is Vespasian’s name; a
    great semi-circular work at the entrance: several Roman coins have been
    found here. Not far off is a ditch called Chiltern, which seems to be
    some division of the hundreds. There is another camp on the other side
    the Willy: then it runs by Grovely, a great wood of your lordship’s:
    it admits another stream coming on the west side of Stonehenge from
    Orcheston, remarkable for a long kind of grass, which without good
    proof I should scruple relating, for it is commonly twenty-five foot
    in length, much coveted by cattle; by Mr. Ray called <i lang="la">gramen caninum
    supinum longissimum</i>: he says they use to fatten hogs with it. This
    Willy, that gives name to Wilton, passes chiefly on the north side
    of the town, makes the canal before the front of the house, and then
    joins the Nadre, coming on the south side of the town and through the
    gardens, at the end of the avenue. The Avon arises from under the great
    ridge of hills that divides Wiltshire into north and south, crowned
    with the Wansditch: it passes southward through innumerable villages
    to <span class="sidenote smcap">Amsbury.</span>Ambsbury, the <i lang="la">pagus Ambri</i> famous for a monastery built by
    one Ambrus, which the monks and fabulous writers have wrested into
    <em>Ambrosbury</em>; then for a celebrated nunnery of noble-women, great
    numbers of whom, against the institution of Nature and Providence,
    were here veiled: it is now the seat of my lord Charlton, built by
    Inigo Jones, and deservedly to be admired: some new works are added
    to it under the direction of my lord Burlington, possessor of his
    spirit, and a noble collection of his designs. The famous old city of
    <em>Sorbiodunum</em> may be said to stand upon this river: it meets with
    the other two just before it passes through Salisbury, and beyond it
    receives the Bourn, which has dropped its proper name: but I guess it
    to have been <em>Colin</em> or <em>Colinity</em>, the same as <em>Clun</em>;
    for at its fountain-head is <em>Colinburn</em>: all these rivers are
    called <em>burns</em>, <em>Willyburn</em>, <em>Adderburn</em>, &amp;c. below
    Salisbury enters another, I suppose called <em>Ebbesburn</em>. From
    Harnham hill we have a view of <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXVII.</span>both Sarums: the old city, with its
    high-crested triple fortifications, threatens all the circumjacent
    country: the new justly boasts of its lofty spire, as wonderful for the
    slenderness of its foundation, as its great height, being 450 foot,
    making one of the visto’s to the front of Wilton-house. To the east
    is <span class="sidenote smcap">Chloridunum.</span>Clarendon, which your lordship first observed, from old writings,
    ought to be called <em>Clorendun</em>, from the famous Roman camp<span class="sidenote">TAB. XLI.</span> half
    a mile off the park near the Roman road: this was made or repaired by
    Constantius Chlorus, father of Constantine the Great; it was he that
    slew Allectus, after he had basely murdered the valiant Carausius.
    Constantius lived at the neighbouring <em>Sorbiodunum</em>: he was of
    British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> extract, the husband of Helena, a famous British princess.
    This camp therefore, properly written, is <em>Chloridunum</em>, being a
    beautiful fortification of a round form upon a dry chalk hill: within
    is a circular ditch, having two entrances answering to the entrances of
    the camp, and leaving a large space between it and the <em>vallum</em>. I
    suppose this ditch was a lesser camp before, inlarged by Chlorus, for
    keeping his legions as in a summer-camp before the city: this they did
    by carrying away all the earth of the old <em>vallum</em> to the new;
    for it is evident the present rampart is of much larger quantity than
    could be taken out of the subjacent ditch. <span class="sidenote">TAB. IX.</span>Chlorendon park is a sweet
    and beautiful place: here king John built him a palace, where several
    Parliaments have been held: part of the building is still left, though
    they have been pulling it down many years: it is chiefly of flint, and
    was a large place upon the side of a hill, but no way fortified. This
    palace of king John answers directly to the front visto of Wilton house
    over the length of the great canal, and is called the King’s Manor:
    they say here is a subterraneous passage to the Queen’s Manor. Between
    the camp and the park runs a Roman road, which has not been taken
    notice of, from <em>Sorbiodunum</em> to Winchester full east and west.</p>

  <p>As we go from Wilton to Stonehenge, between Grovely wood and Woodford
    runs a ditch across the plain, with a high rampart southward: the
    ditch is broad, and goes east and west. I take it to be one of the
    boundaries of the <em>Belgæ</em>, which I call the third: the reason will
    hereafter appear. On the east side of the Avon, by Great Dornford, is
    a very large camp covering the whole top of a hill, of no determinate
    figure, as humouring the height it stands on: it is made intirely
    without any ditch, the earth being heaped up very steep in the nature
    of a parapet, when dug away level at the bottom. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aukbury.</span> Br. <i>oppidum</i>.</span>I doubt not but
    this was a camp of the Britons, and perhaps an <em>oppidum</em>, where
    they retired at night from the pasturage upon the river, with their
    cattle: within it are many little banks, carried strait and meeting one
    another at right angles, square, oblong parallels and some oblique,
    as the meres and divisions between ploughed lands; yet it seems
    never to have been ploughed: and there is likewise a small squarish
    work intrenched, no bigger than a large tent: these to me seem the
    distinctions and divisions for the several quarters and lodgements of
    the people within; for I have, upon the downs in Dorsetshire, often
    remarked the like, of too small a compass to be ploughed fields. This
    camp has an aspect very old; the prominent part of the rampart in
    many places quite consumed by time, though the steep remains perfect;
    one being the natural earth, the other factitious: it certainly has
    so much of the manner of Vespasian’s camp, as induces one to think
    it an imitation. I know not whether we ought to derive the name of
    it from the British <em>Og</em>, signifying the hurdles and pens they
    fence their cattle in with, which perhaps stood upon those meres, or
    little banks, to distinguish every man’s property. Vespasian’s camp
    is within sight of it, a little higher up the river, and on the other
    side: it is a famous camp, properly and by universal consent attributed
    to him, called the <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Walls.</span> Vespasian’s <i>camp</i>.</span>Walls; well chose, being a high piece of ground
    at a flexure of the river, which closes in an end and a side of it:
    the other side has a broad and very deep valley along it, and at the
    other end is the entrance: the whole hangs over the town of Amsbury:
    the manner of this camp too consists mostly in a rampire, but much
    more operose than that last mentioned; the form oblong: the road to
    the town goes quite through it: it is high in the middle, and has a
    barrow inclosed, but partly level; this I suppose originally Celtic, on
    account of its vicinity to Stonehenge, therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> elder than the
    camp. The east side of Vespasian’s camp is sufficiently guarded by the
    precipice of the river. Further northwards, in the road from Ambsbury
    to Marlborough, is the remain of another round camp, extremely old,
    and almost obliterated: this is between Collinburn and Burbich, upon
    a rising ground, seemingly British: and on the west side of the river
    Avon, over-against it, is another, called too <span class="sidenote smcap">Cheselbury.</span>Cheselbury, and said to
    have a fair <em>prætorium</em> in it. These camps so contiguous, with a
    river between, seem still remains of Vespasian’s conquests; and that he
    got the country by inches.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Martinshal Hill.</span> Ro. <i>camp</i>.</div>

  <p>North of these is Martinsal hill, a vast stationary Roman camp, upon
    a high hill steep to the east, which is seldom observable. I measured
    it quite round, in company with lord Hertford and lord Winchelsea:
    it is conspicuous at a great distance, and within sight of all the
    camps in the country. I take it to have<span class="sidenote">TAB. XLIV.</span> been made when the Romans
    were thoroughly possessors of the kingdom, and one of their chief
    fortresses, whence they might give or receive signals all around, in
    case of distress, by fire or smoke. On two sides the precipice is
    dreadfully steep. Lord Winchelsea has a brass <em>Alexander Severus</em>
    found here; on the reverse, <em>Jupiter fulminans</em>, with PM. TR.
    P. COS. On the west side, upon the top of the hill, without the camp
    is a round pit full of good spring water, always to the brim but
    never overflowing in the driest summers; which at those seasons is of
    greatest service to the country round, and thousands of cattle are
    driven every day from a considerable distance to drink there. I am
    told there is another such upon the top of Chute hill, south east from
    hence, very high, and no water within some miles of it. So provident
    has Nature been in subliming, by some unknown powers, the liquid
    element to these barren heights, that every part of her works should
    not be without its graces and use. The prospect from Martinsal must
    needs be exceeding fine. Salisbury steeple, twenty miles off, bears
    south-west and by west: the port of this camp is north-east.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Martinalia.</div>

  <p>I take the name of this hill to come from the merriments among the
    northern people, called <em>Martinalia</em>, or drinking healths to the
    memory of St. Martin, practised by our Saxon and Danish ancestors.
    I doubt not but upon St. Martin’s day, or Martinmass, all the young
    people in the neighbourhood assembled here,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> as they do now upon
    the adjacent St. Ann’s hill upon St. Ann’s day. The true word is
    <em>Martinsheil</em>, <em>heyl</em> signifying health; and the Germans call
    a bowl, or drinking-vessel, <em>schale</em>: likewise <em>hali</em> in the
    Saxon signifies holy; whence our <em>hallow</em>; and the <em>Washeyl</em>
    bowl at Christmass, full of spiced ale, which they carry about, singing
    of carols in the streets. Monsieur Keysler speaks of these matters
    largely in his <cite>Antiquitates Septentrionales</cite>, p. 358. and that
    the German gilds, or societies, were obliged to keep drinking festivals
    to St. Mary, St. Martin, St. Nicholas, &amp;c. p. 487. he says, at a
    village in <em>tractu Albino</em>, the married women upon St. Martin’s
    day pay 4 d. to the questor: and the Spring upon this hill still
    further favoured their ceremonies. So beneficial a bason in heathen
    times merited divine honours; and the people, not willing to part with
    a holy-day, blended their rites into christian. The English took the
    opportunity of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>the day after this great festival of St. Martin, much
    observed by the Danes, to commit that universal massacre upon them
    drunken, which totally extirpated them. This was anno 1002, upon the
    13th of November, the feast day of St. Brittius, says Chron. Joann.
    Alb. Petriburg. on <em>Hock</em> Tuesday, which Spelman says had its
    denomination thence.</p>

  <p>In the fields about Chute are bones dug up very plentifully, in a
    place called Blood-field especially: they likewise found there a stone
    coffin with a skeleton inclosed, and an arrow or spear-head of brass,
    as described to me: there was a horse found buried about three yards
    from the body. Whether this was Roman or British, I cannot affirm: I am
    inclinable to think the latter: but it seems that a battle was fought
    here between them.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Barbury.</span> Ro. <i>camp</i>.</div>

  <p>Full north from hence, upon the Barbury hills, the next ridge
    overlooking the north part of Wiltshire, is another camp, called
    Barbury, in the parish of Ogburn St. George. The noble lords late
    mentioned assisted in measuring it: it is double ditched quite round,
    the inner very deep, and rampart high, of a circular form; an entrance
    upon the east, and another on the west diameter, which is 2000 Roman
    foot long: at the west the inmost rampire retires inwards a little,
    to make a port with jambs: eastward the outer ditch turns round with
    a semi-circular sweep, leaving two passages through it obliquely to
    the main entrance, like our modern half-moons: both these methods I
    have often seen practised.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> This mighty camp stands on one of the
    western eminences of this ridge, running east and west; very steep
    to the north and west, separating the high ground or downs from the
    fertile country below, which belonged to the <em>Dobuni</em>, and lies
    under the eye like a map, as far as the Welsh hills beyond the Severn;
    whose lovely prospect would naturally animate the Britons in its
    defence, as the Romans in its conquest: it is indeed a fine scene of
    woods, towns, pastures, rivers and valleys. A little beyond, upon the
    same ridge, is <span class="sidenote smcap">Badbury.</span>Badbury camp; and the whole is well planted with stout
    camps and frequent, the eye-sore and terror of the plain: hence you see
    Martinsal camp and many more.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Ro. <i>road to</i> <span class="smcap">Bath. via Badonica.</span></div>

  <p>Having recited these matters as preliminary, I shall begin my journey
    from Marlborough, the Roman <em>Cunetio</em>. I forbear speaking of the
    infinite number of Celtic monuments I have found in this country,
    designing them for a particular treatise, to be honoured with your
    lordship’s illustrious name; and from Marlborough pursue the Roman
    road, which we have before traced from Newbury hither, and lately
    discovered its whole progress toward the Bath, which for distinction
    sake we may call <em>Via Badonica</em>: its course is east and west:
    it goes hence all along the north side of the Kennet river, between
    it and the high grounds; and is the present road, but highly wants a
    Roman hand to repair it. When we have rode about a mile, over-against
    Clatford, at a flexure of the river, we meet with several very great
    stones, about a dozen in number, which probably was a Celtic temple,
    and stood in a circle: this form in a great measure they still
    preserve. I guess the Romans buried them in the ground under their
    road, because directly in its passage: the materials throughout have
    since been worn away, or sunk into the ground, being in this place
    meadow, and so has restored their huge bulk to day-light. Hence
    it proceeds directly up to the famous Overton hill, where I first
    discovered its ridge, when surveying the beautiful circle of stones
    there, belonging to the majestic temple of the old Britons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> at Abury:
    this ridge is a little to the north of the present road, somewhat
    higher up the hill; it points directly east and west, one end to
    Marlborough, the other to Silbury hill: and this shows a defect in
    our maps, which place Abury too much to the south: it is perfect for
    some space over the down; but upon descending the hill westward, they
    have ploughed it up, and found several Roman coins near it, some of
    which I have by me.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> At the bottom, by the corner of the hedge,
    it meets again the common road near the White-hart ale-house; and so
    they go together above West Kennet to Silbury-hill: this was the post
    and coach road to the Bath, till, for want of reparation, they were
    forced to find a new one, more northward upon the downs, and farther
    about, through the town of Abury: when on the south side of Silbury
    hill, it goes very strait and full west through the corn-fields on
    the south of Bekhamton, where it is sufficiently known by the name of
    the French way; for what reason I cannot imagine. They have of late
    endeavoured to exclude travellers going upon it, by inclosing it at
    both ends with ditches; but the badness of the lower road has defeated
    their purpose, and made people still assert the public right. Beyond
    Bekhamton it again enters the downs, and marches up the hill in a very
    plain ridge, and beautiful to behold; the pits and cavities whence the
    earth was taken, on both sides, being conspicuous all the way: besides,
    the Romans have defaced a druid’s barrow, and another Celtic one near,
    which saved them some labour: a proof they were there before the Roman
    road; but this is not a proper place to enlarge upon it. When it has
    gained the summit of the hill, it leaves <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oldbury.</span> Ro. <i>camp</i>.</span>Oldbury castle a little to the
    north: this is a great and strong <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLII.</span>Roman camp on the north-west point
    of the hill, overlooking Calne: the precipice on those two sides is
    altogether inaccessible, falling down in narrow cavities or ribs, as
    it were the great roots of a tree, with an odd and tremendous aspect;
    and that way there was need but of very slender work for its security:
    but on the other sides it is double ditched, having but one entrance
    to the east, and that fortified with a return of the outer ditch and
    inner rampire, very artificially: there is a ditch likewise across the
    middle, as if it had been inlarged with an additional intake westward:
    it is in the main of a squarish form, and has a very fine prospect.
    On the northern limit, in the highest part, seems to have been a
    <em>prætorium</em>. On this hill, which is wholly a chalky down, with a
    most delicate turf (and softer to walk upon than a Turky carpet) about
    a foot or two under the superficial earth, they dig great quantities
    of flints to mend the highways withal: one would imagine they had
    been spewed out of the hardening chalk at the creation, as extraneous
    bodies, though of greater specific gravity than itself.</p>

  <p class="clear">Return we to the Roman road, which proceeds across another valley, and
    so towards Runway hill, the highest in all these parts. This was famous
    for a battle in the late civil wars; and they oft find the bullets,
    when digging for the pebbles as afore mentioned; and below the hill
    they plough up the bones of the slain: but much more is Runway eminent
    for two mighty works of antiquity, this Roman way, and Wansdike. The
    most lovely prospect here will tempt even a hasty traveller to cast
    his eyes about him, and see all the country far beyond the Bath,
    and so proportionably quite around. I am not doubtful that it takes
    its name from the Roman way, which here has an unusual and the most
    curious appearance of any I have seen. I took pleasure in examining
    the particularity of it more than once; and it is a masterstroke of
    skill to conduct it down the north side of this long and steep hill
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>(as I have so often remarked to be the condition of northern heights)
    to render it easy, or even practicable. When from the top of this hill
    you look towards Marlborough, which is full east, you may discern
    that the road curves a little northward, not discernible but in the
    whole: the reason is to be attributed to the river Kennet, thrusting
    it out somewhat that way; otherwise the true line should have lain a
    little more to the south of Silbury. To the right you see <span class="sidenote smcap">Wansdike.</span>Wansdike,
    creeping all along from south of Marlborough (about two mile) upon the
    northern edge of the great ridge of hills, parting North and South
    Wiltshire, till it descends St. Ann’s hill; and makes several right
    angles to humour the edges of the other hills: the <em>vallum</em> is
    always on the south side, and the higher ground behind it: then it
    mounts up to the highest <em>apex</em> of Runway hill. But the method
    of the Roman road is this: it goes along the northern side of this
    hill, preserving itself upon the level, being cut like a terrace-walk,
    with a parapet before it next the precipice; and that winding in and
    out, as the curvatures of the hill require: it passes just by Calston
    lime-kiln, and is defaced by it; for the workmen make no scruple to
    dig through it for their materials, and this practice has been so old
    as to denominate the town lying beneath. Soon after, it meets with the
    Wansdike, descending the hill just by the gibbet: here it enters full
    into it, and very dexterously makes use of it, all along to the bottom,
    on a very convenient shelf, or spurn of the hill: at the place of union
    is a flexure of the Wansdike, so that the Roman road coincides with it
    directly; and in order to raise it from a ditch into a road, the Roman
    workmen have thrown in most part of the rampire, still preserving it as
    a terrace to prevent the danger, and the terror of the descent on one side.</p>

  <p>I shall mention, upon another occasion, some other observations
    I have made long since, that overthrow the notion of those that
    imagine Wansdike was cast up by the Saxons, as a limit of the West
    Saxon and Mercian kingdoms, or that its name is derived from their
    god <em>Woden</em>: but here we have a most incontestable proof that
    it was in being before the Roman times; and its very name shows
    it, signifying, in the old British language, the division dike,
    <em>guaban</em>, <em>distinctio</em>, <em>separatio</em>: it is indeed the
    work of the <em>Belgæ</em>, their fourth and last boundary. These two,
    the Roman road and Wansdike, go together after this manner, till they
    enter the inclosures a little north of Hedington town below Runway
    hill. At Calston is a most famous spring, or cataract of water,
    coming out of the chalk-hill, and much talked of. Wansdike was made
    by the people of the south, to cover their country, as the mode of it
    sufficiently testifies, and, as we said before, was the most northern
    bounds of the Belgic kingdom. When from the top of these hills you view
    the Roman road, towards the west you see it butts full upon the Bath,
    or that great chink between Lansdown and the banks of the river Avon
    going to Bristol.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Verlucio.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. LXVIII.</div>

  <p>I had no sooner traced out this road, but I found a fair opportunity
    presented of setting the antiquaries right, as to part of the XIVth
    journey of Antoninus his Itinerary, in which they have hitherto
    been much perplexed. I found no manner of difficulty in settling
    <em>Verlucio</em> at Hedington; <em>Hedda’s</em> town, <em>Heddan</em>
    genitivo. This town is but small at present, lying at the bottom of
    this great hill in a rich marly country. The inhabitants are not
    surprised when you inquire for antiquities; they assert it to have been
    a very old and great city: infinite quantities of antiquities are found
    here: handfuls of coins brought home every time they plough, (madam
    Whitlock has many) and the streets and foundations of houses found for
    a great length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> sufficiently evince it.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Reuben Horsal, clerk
    of Abury, told me, he had seen a gallon of Roman coin taken up at a
    time in Hedington field, in an urn covered with a stone. I suppose
    its original name was <em>Verolucio</em>, as <em>Verolanium</em>, &amp;c. and
    then it signifies, in the old Celtic, the white habitation, <em>vrô
    llug</em>; <em>llug</em> denoting splendid, as <em>Lugdunum</em>, a white
    hill; the same as the Greek Λευκος <em>albus</em>: if <em>lug</em> imports
    pure water, then it must relate to Calston spring, breaking forth like
    a cascade: if we take the word <em>gloyii</em>, <em>limpidus</em>, it is
    all one. It must be noted, that both the XIIIth and XIVth journeys of
    Antoninus his Itinerary are abominably corrupted, and want a healing
    hand as much as any throughout: and being both one journey by a
    different route, I shall undertake thus to restore them.</p>

  <p>In the copies the sum total is set down CIX. miles; when, if you cast
    up the particulars, it amounts to no more than XC. so that no less than
    nineteen in the original is lost: this shows plainly that some station
    is dropped out, and geography itself indispensably demonstrates it. Mr.
    Fulk was sensible of some deficiency, by his adding <em>Gobannium</em>,
    though thereby he hit not the white: in truth, both stations and
    numbers are wanting; for it is notorious that the distance between
    <em>Ariconium</em> and <em>Glevum</em>, places sufficiently known, and
    about which we have no contest, is much too little, when set down only
    XV. mile; and XX. must unavoidably be added. Though I am as cautious
    as any man living in laying hand upon these venerable remains, and
    altering them; yet, where nature and reason absolutely require it,
    I have not the least fear in adding two stations, which are quite
    slipped out from the original: between Cirencester and Newberry
    it is evident <em>Cunetio</em> must be interposed, or the distance
    heightened to twice as much: the truth is, one station is intermitted,
    <em>Cunetio</em>: and the like between <em>Spinas</em> and <em>Calleva</em>;
    for <em>Vindoma</em>, or Silchester, must be added, beyond which is our
    <em>Calleva</em>, or Farnham; all in a strait line, and upon a Roman road
    from <em>Aricomum</em>. Cast up the whole account, it comes to CXXXIX.
    instead of CIX. then all the difficulties that have hitherto obscured
    this journey, vanish: they that compare William Harrison’s first copy
    with the others of this journey, will not be surprised at the effects
    of negligent transcribers, when, out of seven names in other books, he
    has missed two; and so frequently in other journeys. In the next place
    I offer this as the true reading of the fourteenth journey of Antoninus.</p>

  <p class="noindent">This journey leads us to <em>Calleva</em> another way. Mr. Gale has
    observed <em>Trajectus</em> and <em>Abone</em> transposed. The sum total
    here likewise is invariably in all copies CIII. when the particulars
    amount but to ninety-eight; whence we likewise infer a station is
    dropped out, as before, viz. Silchester, with the number X. annexed.
    Now it happens that number was not lost, though the station was; but
    was erroneously placed to Marlborough, being XX. instead of X. seeing
    the distance between the Bath and Marlborough is notoriously too much.
    Setting then X. mile to <em>Cunetio</em>, its real distance from our
    <em>Verlucio</em>, Hedington; it remains further to correct the number
    annexed to <em>Verlucio</em>, XX. for XV. the letter X being easily
    corrupted into an V. then we answer the distances on all hands, having
    a Roman road accompanying us, and complete the sum total set at top
    precisely CIII. and restore the whole to its ancient purity. When we
    reflect a little, that, take the matter how we will any other way, the
    difficulties are unsurmountable, I am thoroughly satisfied in these
    corrections.</p>

  <p>Much rusty old iron is dug up at the quarries by Brunham, probably of
    the Romans: it is a mile off Hedington.</p>

  <p>Upon the hedge of the hill which overlooks Hedington, as it bends a
    little southward, is another pretty little Roman camp, in an angle of
    the hill, of a square form, and as if not finished, or made for but
    a small time of abode upon an expedition; for neither <em>vallum</em>
    nor ditch of any great strength: it is situate on a very convenient
    promontory, or rather <em>peninsula</em> of high ground, the steepness
    whereof is a guard to three sides of it; the other has the slender
    <em>vallum</em> made chiefly of the surface of the earth thrown up a
    little. From the edge of these hills is an indefinite prospect over the
    country of the <em>Dobuni</em>, the <em>Belgæ</em>, and <em>Durotriges</em>:
    the descent to it, as being on the west side of the hill, is very
    steep. I think this place is called Bagdon hill.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Punctuobice.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. LXIX.</div>

  <p>Under it, to the left, is the Devises: this I take to be the
    <em>Punctuobice</em> of Ravennas, which he mentions by parcels thus:
    <em>Leucomagus</em>, Bedwin, (<em>Cimetzone</em> for) <em>Cunetione</em>
    in the ablative case, Marlborough; <em>Punctuobice</em>, the Devises:
    then he begins a new period of cities in Wales, <em>Venta Silurum</em>,
    &amp;c. I suppose here is a remnant of the former part of the word
    <em>Punctuobice</em> in Poulsholt, a little village hard by; Potern
    another, Potern-wood, and the name of the hundred Potern, taken, in
    the first times of their division, from such a corrupt appellation
    of this place: the last syllable <em>bice</em> subsists in the present
    name Devises, vulgarly <em>vies</em>. This town is excellently situated,
    about two miles from the bottom of the hills, which keep <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>off the
    eastern winds, and in a rich soil.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Under the hill at Runway is an
    excellent spring, which the inhabitants have not yet found means to
    convey thither, though it runs but a little way off the town, where
    they want water. It is a very large old town, consisting chiefly of
    two long parallel streets; the houses for the most part of timber, but
    of a very good model: they value themselves for one of the best weekly
    markets in England, and for being tenants to the king. It was inclosed
    by the Romans with a <em>vallum</em> and ditch, which I presently found
    out: they have made a road of the ditch in most parts round the town;
    but in several places both that and the <em>vallum</em> are visible
    enough, and it took in the castle: this castle was Roman originally,
    finely chosen upon a natural fortification, but in after-times made in
    a manner impregnable by Roger a bishop of Salisbury; though now it is
    ignobly mangled, and every day destroyed by people that care not to
    leave a wall standing, though for a fence to their garden. Here are two
    churches; the choir of St. Mary’s, of a very old model; the steeple,
    choir, and both wings of St. John’s, the same, to which parcels have
    since been tacked all round, and new wide windows put in with pointed
    arches, instead of the ancient narrow semi-circular ones. Just out of
    town is a pretty plain, called the Green, with another handsome church
    and steeple, suburbs to the old town. Here William Cadby, a gardener,
    dug up his collection of gods, which he carried about for a show:
    they were found in a garden, in a cavity inclosed with Roman brick:
    the <em>Venus</em> is of an excellent design; and the Vestal Virgin, as
    they call it, a fragment of Corinthian brass; it is of very curious
    drapery: <em>Vulcan</em> is as lame as if made at a forge: the rest equal
    in designing with the <em>lares</em> of the <em>Ostiaques</em>, and not
    at all mended in the plate published by Dr. Musgrave: he had several
    coins found thereabouts, and a brass Roman key which my lord Winchelsea
    bought. Roman antiquities are found here every day. My lord Winchelsea
    has one brass <em>Probus</em>; on the reverse, <span class="smcap">Victoria Germ.</span>
    with a trophy: and a great fund of such antiquities is to be met with
    all around the country. At Calne incredible numbers of Roman coin dug
    up; so at Studley, in the way to Bath, once a seat of the Saxon kings:
    I have seen and bought some of these: my lord Winchelsea has many found
    there.</p>

  <p>From hence towards Trubridge is Steeple-Aston, upon the bottom of the
    downs of Salisbury plain: it is a most excellent church and tower of
    stone, and had a famous spire of lead upon it, but twice thrown down by
    thunder and tempest, which absolutely discouraged the inhabitants from
    setting it up again.</p>

  <p>Return we to the Roman Bath road, which we left at Hedington; whence
    it goes much as the common road to Bath, and all along upon the south
    division of Chipenham hundred: I could discern its bank now and then
    upon the road, though much worn away and defaced in defect of necessary
    repairs: it passes the Avon at Lacock, where has been a great religious
    house, so by a chapel south of Haselbury: then it descends a hill
    for two miles together, till it meets, over-against Bathford, the
    Foss-way, which comes in a strait line hither through Cirencester,
    from <em>Benonis</em> or High-cross in Warwickshire, where I left it
    last year: then our road goes round the crook of the river by Walcot
    to the Bath. This turn it is that swells the distance between Bath
    and <em>Verlucio</em> to XX. Roman miles, as we before corrected it.
    The Wansdike runs still not far off this road, but a little <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>north of
    it through Spy park; so by Ditchbridge, which has its name from it;
    then to the Shire stones, at the division between Gloucestershire,
    Wilts, and Somerset. As to the nature of the soil, when we have left
    the chalky downs at Hedington, it is intirely sand to the river Avon,
    whence the name of Sandy lanes: from thence to the Bath it is rocky.
    There is a vast descent from the Downs quite to Bath, and every great
    ridge is very steep westward.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aquæ Solis.</span></div>

  <p>The Bath is a place so celebrated, and so well known, that I need say
    but little upon it; nor can much be expected from the small time I
    rested here:<span class="sidenote">TAB. LXX. LXXI.</span> its history and antiquities have been copiously handled
    by several gentlemen of our own faculty. It is indeed a spot of ground
    which we Britons may esteem as a particular boon of Nature: it lies
    in a great valley surrounded with an amphitheatrical view of hills;
    and its situation on the west side of the island does not a little
    contribute to its pleasures; for such is ever less subject to violent
    and enormous alterations of the air by winds and tempest, heat and
    cold: but the Romans were prudently induced to make a station here, by
    the admirable hot springs, so wonderful in themselves, and so justly
    regarded. The walls round the city are for the most part intire, and
    perhaps the old Roman work, except the upper part, which seems repaired
    with the ruins of Roman buildings; for the lewis holes are still left
    in many of the stones, and, to the shame of the repairers, many Roman
    inscriptions: some sawn across, to fit the size of the place, are
    still to be seen, some with the letters towards the city, others on
    the outside: most of those mentioned in Mr. Camden and other authors
    are still left; but the legend more obscure. The level of the city
    is risen to the top of the first walls, through the negligence of
    the magistracy, in this and all other great towns, who suffer idle
    servants to throw all manner of dirt and ashes into the streets: these
    walls inclose but a small compass, of a pentagonal form: four gates
    on four sides, and a postern on the other: from the south-west angle
    has been an additional wall and ditch carried out to the river; by
    which short work the approach of an enemy on two sides is cut off,
    unless they pass the river. The small compass of the city has made
    the inhabitants croud up the streets to an unseemly and inconvenient
    narrowness: it is handsomely built, mostly of new stone, which is
    very white and good; a disgrace to the architects they have there.
    The cathedral is a beautiful pile, though small; the roof of stone
    well wrought; much imagery in front, but of a sorry taste. Here they
    suppose (with probability) stood the Roman temple of Minerva, patroness
    of the Baths.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Before it was a handsome square <em>area</em>, but
    lately deformed with houses encroaching: on the south side are the
    justly-renowned hot springs, collected into a square <em>area</em> called
    the King’s Bath. The corporation has lately erected a pretty handsome
    building before it, called the Drinking-room, for the company to meet
    in that drink the waters drawn hither by a marble pump from the bottom
    of the springs, where it is near boiling hot. This water is admirably
    grateful to the stomach, striking the roof of the mouth with a fine
    sulphureous and steely <em>gas</em>, like that of the German Spa or
    Pyrmont: though you drink off a large pint glass, yet it is so far
    from creating a heaviness, or <em>nausea</em>, that you find yourself
    brisker immediately, by its agreeable sensation on the membranes of the
    stomach: at first it operates <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>by stool, and especially urine: it
    is of most sovereign virtue to strengthen the bowels, to restore their
    lost tone through intemperance or inactivity, and renews the vital
    fire by its adventitious heat and congenial principles. Hither let the
    hypochondriac student repair, and drink at the Muses’ spring: no doubt
    the advantages obtained here in abdominal obstructions must be very
    great. The King’s Bath is an oblong square; the walls full of niches,
    perhaps the Roman work: there are twelve on the north side, eight on
    the east and west; about four larger arches on the south: at every
    corner are the steps to descend into it, and a parapet or balustrade
    with a walk round it: in the middle is set an aukward timber-work, like
    a cross, adorned with crutches, the trophies of its wonderful cures:
    around that emerge the boiling springs very plentifully: upon the south
    wall is the fanciful image of king Bladud, with a silly account of his
    finding out these springs, more reasonably attributed to the Romans:
    they no doubt separated them first from common springs, and fenced them
    in with an eternal wall. The people have a notion, and probable enough,
    of subterraneal canals of their making, to carry off the other waters,
    lest they should mix and spoil the heat of these. It is remarkable
    that at the cleansing of the springs, when they set down a new pump,
    they constantly find great quantities of hazle-nuts, as in many other
    places among subterraneous timber. These I doubt not to be the remains
    of the famous and universal deluge, which the Hebrew historian tells
    us was in autumn, Providence by that means securing the revival of the
    vegetable world. In this bath the people stand up to the chin, men and
    women, and stew, as we may properly call it; for the most part, in the
    way of gallantry, and as at a collation. I should judge the method used
    at Buxton preferable, where the sexes go in separately and privately,
    where they have liberty to swim about and stir the limbs, and exercise
    the lungs; whence the whole body will better receive the full force and
    benefit of the warmth: and this will more effectually put the humours
    in motion, that should be exterminated at the opened pores: this
    exercise of the solids sets the glands to work, and every secretion
    is promoted. Many are the diseases and calamities which here find a
    happy period, when judiciously applied, which, as a traveller, I need
    not discourse upon. This brings innumerable people to the salutiferous
    streams; especially in the summer time, which likewise seems an error
    owing to custom and fashion; for I doubt not they are equally, if
    not more beneficial, both internally and externally, in winter than
    summer. The carrying the water to distant places to drink, seems only a
    splendid fallacy.</p>

  <p>I observe the whole country hereabouts is a rock of good lime-stone,
    which is the <em>minera</em> of the water’s heat and virtue: but how that
    comes to be calcined; by what refined chymistry of Nature sulphur and
    steel are mixed with it; by what means it acquires and conserves with
    so much constancy this equable and mighty <em>focus</em>, together with
    the reason of fountains in general; I profess, in my sentiments, is one
    of the great <em>arcana</em> in philosophy hitherto inscrutable.</p>

  <p>Behind the southern wall of the King’s Bath is a lesser square, called
    the Queen’s Bath, with a tabernacle of four pillars in the midst: this
    is of more temperate warmth, as deriving its water at second-hand from
    the other. There are likewise pumps and pumping-rooms, for pouring hot
    streams on any part of the body; which in many cases is very useful,
    to dissolve sizy concretions about the joints and the like, and
    recovers the natural elasticity in the relaxed fibres of the solids.
    The <em>area</em> before this bath and front of the cathedral, is in
    the centre of the <em>pentagon</em>, upon which the city is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> formed.
    Why the Romans made it of this unusual figure, I cannot tell: nothing
    appears from the manner of the ground and situation; but I observe
    the same of Aix in France. One would be apt to suspect they had a
    regard to the sacred symbol and mystical character of medicine, which
    in ancient times was thought of no inconsiderable virtue: this is a
    pentagonal figure, formed from a triple triangle, called by the name
    of <em>Hygeia</em>, because to be resolved into the Greek letters that
    compose the word. The Pythagoreans used it among their disciples as a
    mystical symbol, denoting health; and the cabalistic Jews and Arabians
    had the same fancy: it is the <em>pentalpha</em>, or <em>pentagrammon</em>,
    among the Egyptians; the mark of prosperity. Antiochus Soter, going
    to fight against the Galatians, was advised in a dream to bear this
    sign upon his banner; whence he obtained a signal victory. This would
    make one believe a physician had a hand in projecting this city. Dr.
    Musgrave thinks it was Scribonius, who accompanied Claudius hither.</p>

  <p>In the south-west part of the town are two other baths, not to be
    disregarded: for in any other place who would not purchase them at
    the greatest price? The Hot bath is a small parallelogram, not much
    inferior in heat to the King’s bath: it has a stone tabernacle of four
    pillars in the middle. The Cross bath, near it, is triangular, and had
    a cross in the middle; which now is a very handsome work, in marble,
    of three Corinthian pillars, erected by the lord Milford, in memory
    of king James the Second’s queen conceiving, as it is said, after the
    use thereof. Hard by is an hospital built and endowed by a bishop of
    this see. The water in these two places rises near to the level of the
    streets, because I suppose in this part of the town the earth is not
    so much heightened. On the south side of the cathedral are some parts
    of the abbey left, and the gate-house belonging to it. Not long ago,
    by money contributed, they made a cold bath, at a spring beyond the
    bridge, that nothing of this sort might be wanting for the benefit of
    the infirm.</p>

  <p>Since Mr. Camden’s time two inscriptions have been set in the eastern
    wall of the cathedral, fronting the walks: but this is as imprudently
    done as those in the city-walls; for, besides the rain and weather,
    they are exposed to the boys, who throw stones at them: one is that of
    Julius Vitalis, published by Dr. Musgrave; the other, which he calls a
    basso relievo of Geta, seems to have been the top of a monumental stone
    over some common horseman. <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLIX.</span>Harrison’s house, they say, is built against
    some basso’s and inscriptions. In the <a href="#i_148_1">49th plate</a> I have given the whole
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLI. 2d Vol.</span>stone and inscription, now in the wall near the north gate.</p>

  <p>At Walcot has been a camp, and many Roman antiquities are frequently
    found. Lord Winchelsea has an urn, a <em>patera</em>, and other things,
    found in a stone coffin, wherein was a child’s body, half a mile off
    the Bath.</p>

  <p>Riding upon Lansdown, I saw the monument, lately erected by lord
    Lansdown, in memory of his grandfather Bevil Granvile, slain here in
    a battle with the parliament forces. Hence, it being a north-west
    precipice, is a prospect of Bristol, the Severn, &amp;c. This road seems
    to be the Ricning-street, called Langridge, going to the passage over
    the Severn, the ancient <em>Trajectus</em> and so along the east side
    of the Severn, and into Yorkshire. The ground hereabouts is very red,
    covering a solid rock of stone, which lies in thin layers parallel to
    the horizon, with as much exactness as if hewn for courses in a wall:
    this stone is full of little shells; and of this sort is the monument
    of Julius Vitalis: between the <em>strata</em> are crystallizations or
    fluors of petrifying juices: all the stone in this country abounds
    with curious fossils. As you walk along a new paved road, it is
    very common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> to find very great <i lang="la">cornua ammonis</i>, two foot
    diameter, laid in among the rest; and, though formed with such
    admirable curiosity, yet the country people walk carelessly over them,
    as I observed, whilst a horse will startle at so unusual an appearance:
    the first I saw in the Foss road, going up the hill south of Bath, I
    took for the image of the Sun, which I remembered to have seen prints
    of, as it was in <i lang="la">basso relievo</i> in the city-walls, with his hair
    flowing round like rays; and this was well enough represented in a
    stone that had been worn a little: but I was soon undeceived, when I
    found great numbers of the same sort further on.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

  <p class="clear"><span class="sidenote"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Weddings</span>. Br. <i>Temple</i>.</span>
    From the Bath I went to visit the famous Celtic temple called the
    Weddings, in company with John Strachey, esq; who lives near there,
    a person well versed in natural history and antiquities, and fellow
    of the Royal Society. I shall describe this memorable curiosity upon
    another occasion. In the way hither, about Twyfordton, I found a
    <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Marsbury</span> <i>field</i>.</span>fallow field with but little quantity of earth upon the rock: this
    was as full of fossil shells as possible, let into a softish stone,
    which had preserved their very natural colour of blue and white
    as perfectly as at first. Near Stanton Drue, in a <em>trivium</em>,
    is an old elm-tree made infamous for the bloody trophies of judge
    Jeffrys’s barbarity, in the duke of Monmouth’s rebellion; for all its
    broad-spreading arms were covered over with heads and limbs of the
    unfortunate countrymen. In Chu parish is <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Bowditch</span> <i>camp</i>.</span>Bowditch, a large camp on a
    hill trebly fortified, whence you may behold the isles of Flatholm
    and Steepholm in the sea. I suppose the word means the circular form
    of the place. Here is a petrifying spring. This country abounds with
    coal-pits: the slates that lie upon it, and have not received their due
    quantity of sulphur, so as to make perfect coal, are most curiously
    marked with impressions of plants, capillary ones especially, and more
    particularly those of fern; all which grew in exceeding plenty in this
    country, and gave their forms to this soft matter at the Deluge. This
    is indeed a rock, and full of springs, very bad road for travelling,
    short and steep valleys, narrow lanes, intricate, dark and hard: so
    no wonder <em>harts-tongue</em>, <em>liver-wort</em>, <em>maiden-hair</em>,
    <em>navel-wort</em>, and the like moist plants, thrive here. The ground
    in these valleys is very rich: much wood grows upon it; though in some
    roads you ride upon the superfice of a rock lying flat in great slabs,
    as if artificially placed with good joints. Many wood-plants grow about
    here, such as <em>wood-sorrel</em>, <em>strawberries</em>, <em>tutsan</em> or
    <em>park-leaves</em>, &amp;c. The neatness of the houses even of the poorer
    sort of people is remarkable, being generally whited over, and with
    pretty little gardens, which in pure and unartful nature is a necessary
    adjunct in the happiness of life.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>Camps.</i></div>

  <p>There is a camp overlooks Stanton Drue, called Mizknoll; another at
    Elm, two miles west from Frome: in 1691 a pot of Roman coin found
    there, most of Constantine junior: it is upon the end of a precipice,
    and severed from the rest of the hill by a <em>vallum</em> on one side
    only: south of it runs a rivulet. Masbury castle upon Mendip hills,
    half a mile from the Foss, a mile north of Shipton-Mallet, of a round
    form, 150 paces diameter: the two entrances opposite: the environing
    ditch on one end laps over with a semi-lunar turn, rendering the
    passage to it oblique. Hereabouts are many camps, whose ditches are
    hewn out of the solid rock: that above Bristol has four trenches,
    as many <em>vallums</em>, and but one entrance: one would think it
    impregnable to any thing but hunger. A camp cut out of the rock at
    Churchill with a single trench. There is a cave equal to that of
    Ochey-hole at Dolebury. These are from information of Mr. Strachey.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

  <p>In this county of Somersetshire are three remarkable hills, that make
    an exact triangle twelve mile each side, much talked of by the country
    people; Camalet castle, Glassenbury torr, and Montacute. They have a
    notion that king Arthur obtained from some saint, that no serpent or
    venomous creature should ever be found in this compass, though frequent
    all around it. I shall rehearse to your lordship what occurred to me
    at the places. All this country, though to the eye very pleasant with
    woods and prospects yet is very disagreeable to travel, for the reasons
    I just mentioned.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Colomeæ.</span></div>

  <p>Camalet is a noted place, situate on the highest ground in this
    county, on the edge of Dorsetshire. <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLIII.</span>The country people are ignorant
    of this name, which has generally obtained among the learned: they
    call it Cadbury castle, from the village of North-Cadbury, in which
    it is: this caution is useful to those that go to enquire for it.
    Hereabouts rise the rivers of Somersetshire, which run into the
    Severn sea westward; and that in Dorset, which goes eastward, through
    Sturminster, into the southern ocean. It is a noble fortification of
    the Romans, placed on the north end of a ridge of hills separated from
    the rest by nature; and for the most part solid rock, very steep and
    high: there are three or four ditches quite round, sometimes more: the
    <em>area</em> within is twenty acres at least, rising in the middle:
    its figure is squarish, but conforms to the shape of the hill. There
    is a higher angle of ground within, ditched about, where they say was
    king Arthur’s palace: it was probably the <em>prætorium</em> and might
    be king Arthur’s too. who lived in this place: the country people
    refer all stories to him. The whole has been ploughed over since the
    memory of man, and much stone has been taken from the surface, which
    has altered it. The rampart is large and high, made chiefly of great
    stones covered with earth, and perhaps, in some parts where it was
    necessary, laid with mortar: here is only one entrance from the east.
    It is not unlikely there were buildings erected in the later British
    times, being of so great strength, and a perfect watch-tower, surveying
    the country round to an incredible distance. The prospect is woody,
    and very pleasant; here and there little hills, lofty and steep,
    peeping up with their naked heads: you reach all the Mendip hills and
    Black-down in Devonshire. In this camp they find many pebble-stones
    exactly round, half a peck at a time; whereas there are none such in
    the country: they suppose them stones to sling withal, fetched from
    the sea, or perhaps shot in cross-bows. Roman coin in great plenty
    has been found here, and all the country round: I saw vast numbers
    of Antoninus and Faustina, about that time and after. The entrance
    here is guarded with six or seven ditches: on the north side, in the
    fourth ditch, is a never-failing spring, called King Arthur’s well:
    over it they have dug up square stones, door-jambs with hinges, and
    say there are subterraneous vaults thereabouts. Selden, in his notes
    on <em>Polyolbion</em>, writes it was full of ruins and reliques of old
    buildings. At top they told me many pavements, and arches have been dug
    up, hand-grindstones, and other domestic or camp utensils. They say
    there is a road across the fields, that bears very rank corn, called
    King Arthur’s Hunting-causeway.</p>

  <p class="clear"><span class="sidenote smcap">Cadbury.</span>The church and tower of Cadbury is neat and small, built of stone.
    In this place they call walnuts <em>Welsh-nuts</em>. To the southward,
    on the opposite hill, corpses have been dug up: there was lately an
    urn full of Roman money found at Wincaunton. A little above Sutton,
    toward Beacon-Ash, in inclosing ground, half a peck of the same coin
    was found; I saw some of Tetricus. Roman <em>pateras</em>, a knife, and
    other antiquities, taken up thereabouts, sent to madam Thyns, now in
    lord Winchelsea’s custody.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> Many are the British stories told of
    Camalet, of the knights of king Arthur’s round table, of the solemn
    justings and tournaments there, &amp;c. It seems, when the castle for
    its security was turned into a city, this was the <em>Colomeæ</em> of
    Ravennas, (as Mr. Baxter has corrected it) in the later times of the
    Romans; unless Quincamel, not far off, can better put in its claim, to
    which this might be the garrison. At Long-Leat, in my lord Weymouth’s
    library, is a piece of lead weighing fifty pound, one foot nine inches
    long, two inches thick, three and an half broad, found in the lord
    Fitzharding’s grounds near Bruton in Somersetshire, and was discovered
    by digging a hole to set a gate-post in: upon it this memorable
    inscription, which I suppose was some trophy; communicated by lord
    Winchelsea.</p>

  <p>Hence let us go, as in pilgrimage, to the famous Glassenbury; for it is
    a very rough and disagreeable road, over rocks and the heads of rivers:
    but that is much alleviated by the many natural curiosities such places
    afford: several times I saw <em>gilded ivy</em> grow in the hedges, as
    yellow as gold; great plenty of <em>viorna</em>, <em>purging-thorn</em>,
    <em>prim-print</em>, and the banks every where over-grown with
    <em>fox-gloves</em>. Kyneton village, for half a mile together, is paved
    naturally with one smooth broad rock, the whole breadth of the road;
    so that it looks like ice. Great quarries of stone hereabouts, of the
    slab kind: all the uppermost layers are incredibly full of sea-shells,
    and would make admirable pannels to wainscot a <em>virtuoso’s</em>
    summer-house, grotto, or the like, and of any dimensions; not inferior,
    in true value, to those brought from Italy, but too cheap. I frequently
    took notice that the course of the vein of the stone quarry runs
    north-east and south-west.</p>

  <p>Crossing the Foss road at Lyteford you enter upon a flat moorish
    country, full of artificial cuts and drains, like the levels in
    Lincolnshire. Not far before I came to Glassenbury, I observed a great
    bank, crossing the road, which seemed to be a Roman road. I guess there
    was a Roman road went from Bristol, through Axbridge, Bridgewater,
    Taunton, parallel to the Foss, and nearer the ocean. I have been told,
    between the two last places it is very fair, and paved with stone. With
    much labour I climbed to the top of the Torr, hanging over the town of
    <span class="sidenote smcap">Glasenbury Torr</span>Glassenbury. This hill, with that called Werial hill, is a long rib of
    elevated ground in the midst of this vast level or isle of <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXVII.</span>Avalon. I
    observed, in its several breaks or gradations, a steepness westward.
    Here upon the narrow crest of the Torr, which is much the highest, the
    abbots built a church to St. Michael, of good square stone: the tower
    is left, though ruinous; and it is an excellent sea-mark: it probably
    cost more to carry the stone up to this <em>apex</em>, than to erect the
    building. There is a spring half way up it. It is certainly higher than
    any ground within ten miles of the place. They say here is a passage
    hence under ground to the abbey.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Glasenbury.</div>

  <p>This great monastery in superstitious times held the first place for
    fame and sanctity. Here the christian doctrine first found admittance
    in Britain, or early tradition has amused us: it is not unlikely the
    fact may be true, <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXIII.</span>though the persons and circumstances invented:
    however, it is not to be doubted but king Ina built their church; as
    one of the most ancient, so the most wealthy and magnificent, loaded
    with revenues by the Saxon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> kings, and perhaps the British before
    them. Truly the abbot lived in no less state than the royal donors: no
    wonder, when his revenue was equivalent to 40,000l. per ann. he could
    from the Torr see a vast tract of this rich land his own demesnes,
    and seven parks well stored with deer belonging to the monastery. It
    is walled round and embattled like a town, a mile in compass: as yet
    there are magnificent ruins; but within a <em>lustrum</em> of years, a
    presbyterian tenant has made more barbarous havock there, than has
    been since the Dissolution; for every week a pillar, a buttress, a
    window-jamb, or an angle of fine hewn stone, is sold to the best
    bidder: whilst I was there they were excoriating St. Joseph’s chapel
    for that purpose, and the squared stones were laid up by lots in the
    abbot’s kitchen: the rest goes to paving yards and stalls for cattle,
    or the highway. I observed frequent instances of the townsmen being
    generally afraid to make such purchase, as thinking an unlucky fate
    attends the family where these materials are used; and they told me
    many stories and particular instances of it: others, that are but half
    religious, will venture to build stables and out-houses therewith, but
    by no means any part of the dwelling-house. The abbot’s lodging was a
    fine stone building, but could not content the tenant just mentioned,
    who pulled it down two or three years ago, and built a new house out of
    it; aukwardly setting up the arms and cognisances of the great Saxon
    kings and princes, founders, and of the abbots, over his own doors and
    windows: <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXVII.</span>my friend Mr. Strachey had taken a drawing of it very luckily
    just before, <span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXIV.</span>which I have put in its proper place, <a href="#i_152_1">plate 37</a>. Nothing
    is reserved intire but the kitchen, a judicious piece of architecture:
    it is formed from an octagon included in a square; four fire-places
    fill the four angles, having chimneys over them: in the flat part of
    the roof, between these, rises the arched octagonal pyramid, crowned
    with a double lantern, one within another: there are eight curved ribs
    within, which support this vault, and eight funnels for letting out
    the steam through windows; within which, in a lesser pyramid, hung the
    bell to call the poor people to the adjacent almery, whose ruins are
    on the north side of the kitchen: the stones of the pyramid are all
    cut slaunting with the same bevil to throw off the rain. They have a
    report in the town, that king Henry VIII. quarrelling with the abbot,
    threatened to fire his kitchen: to which he returned answer, That he
    would build such a one as all the timber in his forest should not burn.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XXXVI.</div>

  <p>The church was large and magnificent: the walls of the choir are
    standing, twenty-five fathom long, twelve broad: there is one jamb
    at the east end of the high altar left: hereabouts were buried king
    Edgar, and many of the Saxon kings, whose noble ashes ought to have
    protected the whole: two pillars of the great middle tower are left
    next the choir: on the north side is St. Mary’s chapel, as they told
    me; the roof beat down by violence, and a sorry wooden one in its
    place, thatched with stubble to make it serve as a stable: the manger
    lies upon the altar and niche where they put the holy water. St.
    Edgar’s chapel is opposite to it; not much left of it, beside the
    foundations: the north and south transepts are quite demolished. They
    say king Arthur was buried under the great tower. A small part of the
    south side wall of the body of the church remains, which made one side
    of the cloysters; and the arch at the west end, leading to the chapel
    of Joseph of Arimathea, the patron and asserted founder of the whole.
    This they say was the first christian church in Britain. The present
    work is about the third building upon the same spot:<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXV.</span> it is forty-four
    paces long, thirty-six wide without: it is so intire, that we could
    well enough draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> the whole structure, as in <a href="#i_152_4">plate 35</a>. the roof
    is chiefly wanting: two little turrets are at the corners of the west
    end, and two more at the interval of four windows from thence, which
    seem to indicate the space of ground the first chapel was built on: the
    rest between it and the church was a sort of anti-chapel. Underneath
    was a vault now full of water, the floor of the chapel being beaten
    down into it: it was wrought with great stones. Here was a capacious
    receptacle of the dead: they have taken up many leaden coffins, and
    melted them into cisterns. Hence is the subterraneous arched passage
    to the Torr, according to their notion. The roof of the chapel was
    finely arched with rib-work of stone: the sides of the walls are full
    of small pillars of Sussex marble, as likewise the whole church; which
    was a little way of ornamenting in those days: they are mostly beaten
    down: between them the walls are painted with pictures of saints, as
    still easily seen. All the walls are overgrown with ivy, which is the
    only thing here in a flourishing condition; everything else presenting
    a most melancholy, though venerable aspect. On the south side the
    cloysters was the great hall. The town’s people bought the stone of<span class="sidenote">TAB. XXXVII.</span>
    the vaults underneath to build a sorry market-house, contributing to
    the ruin of the sacred fabric, and to their own: what they durst not
    have done singly, they perpetrated as a body, hoping vengeance would
    slip between so many: nor did they discern the benefit accruing to
    the town from the great concourse of strangers purposely to see this
    abbey, which is now the greatest trade of it, as formerly its only
    support; for it is in a most miserable decaying condition, as wholly
    cut off from the great revenues spent among them. There are many
    other foundations of the buildings left in the great <em>area</em>, but
    in the present hands will soon be rooted up, and the very footsteps
    of them effaced, which so many ages had been erecting. Though I am
    no encourager of superstitious foppery, yet I think, out of that
    vast estate, somewhat might have been left, if only to preserve old
    monuments for the benefit of our history. The abbot’s hall I have been
    told was curiously wainscoted with oak, and painted with coats of arms
    in every pannel. The mortar of these buildings is very good, and great
    rocks of the roof of the church lie upon the ground, consisting chiefly
    of rubble stone untouched by the fanatical destroyers, who work on the
    hewn stone of the outside, till a whole wall falls when undermined a
    little. Throughout the town are the tattered remains of doors, windows,
    bases, capitals of pillars, &amp;c. brought from the abbey, and put into
    every poor cottage.</p>

  <p class="clear mt4">In the town are two churches; the upper a handsome fabric, with a fine
    tower of good design, adorned with figures in niches: at the east end
    of the church-yard is a curious old tomb inscribed with ancient English
    letters, but so worn with trampling on, that I could make little out
    of it, except the name of the interred Alleyn. The George inn is an
    old stone building, called the Abbot’s inn, where chiefly the pilgrims
    were lodged that came strolling hither, and idling their time away for
    sanctity: stone and timber are liberally bestowed on it: a coat of arms
    of the kings of England, supported by a lion and a bull, over the gate,
    and many crosses: the bed I lay in was of large timber, with great
    embossed gilt pannels, and seemed to have been the abbot’s.</p>

  <p>When I left this place, I passed through a great gate built across
    the road under the abbey wall, with a lesser portal by the side of
    it; which I suppose was some boundary of the abbey-lands, and part of
    their extravagance; for the abbot’s revenues being inconsumable in
    their way of life, they prodigally threw it away in building, as one
    method of perpetuating their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> name: another they had which was very
    useful, the making great and high causeways, along this moory country,
    for facilitating travelling and commerce; the remains of which I saw
    here and there, and wished they had been in better repair. I passed by
    the side of Werial hill, where grew the famous hawthorn that blossomed
    at Christmas; I suppose, an early blooming white-thorn: but that it
    so strictly observed Christmas day to an hour, nay a minute, as they
    here assert, I believe no more than the vulgar derivation of the hill,
    with more of the dregs of monkery. Somerton is an old town, that gives
    name to the whole county, once the royal seat of the West-Saxon kings:
    the steeple is octangular: probably it was a Roman town. I saw a camp
    upon a great copped high hill on the right hand, as I travelled. At
    Ilchester town end I fell into the Foss road again.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Ischalis.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. LXXII.</div>

  <p>This station of the Romans is situate on the south side of the river
    Ivel, or Yeovil, the <em>Velox</em> of Ravennas. Pillbridge, a little
    lower, seems to retain the name: it is the <em>Uzella</em> of Ptolemy. I
    perceived immediately that this place had been originally encompassed
    with a wall and ditch, and traced out the manifest <em>vestigia</em>
    thereof quite round: it was an oblong square 300 paces in length, 200
    in breadth, standing upon the oblique points of the compass, conform
    to the Foss way, which passes through the town exactly from north-east
    to south-west: the north-east side of the city lay against the river,
    where I saw foundations of the wall here and there, and took up several
    Roman bricks in searching for it in the gardens: the ditch on the
    north-west side is become a road, called Yard-lane, as going behind
    the yards and gardens: then it runs through the friery garden; for the
    religious had extended their bounds beyond the city, and turned the
    road on the outside: then it goes along the road on the back of Mr.
    Lockyer’s garden: it is now visible between the Yeovil road and the
    southern angle; then runs through another garden, being for the most
    part levelled by the gardener, who showed me the track of it, and had
    by times, in digging, taken up remainders of the wall, with many coins,
    bricks, tiles, and other antiquities. I bought some coins of him, among
    which the brass one of Antoninus Pius depicted in the plate; on the
    reverse, Britannia sitting on a rock with a military ensign. Sir Philip
    Sydenham has a great quantity of coins found here, and the minister of
    the parish gave many to the learned Mr. Coke of Norfolk. This gardener
    showed me many square paving bricks in the floor of his house, and told
    me he dug up a great brass coin, as big as half a crown, under the
    foundation of the wall, which doubtless would have discovered to us
    the <em>area</em> of its building. Crossing the Sherburn and Limington
    road, we find the ditch again, turning up to the river-side, on the
    eastern angle, conformable to the scheme; where it is again inclosed
    into gardens and pastures: the occupier of the gardens there informed
    me too, that he had frequently dug up the like antiquities, together
    with the foundations of the wall. The quickset-hedge that fences in
    the garden stands on the edge of the ditch, and observes its turn at
    that angle of the city: by the new mill it meets the river. In all the
    gardens hereabouts, by the Borough-green, they find foundations of old
    houses; and some run across the present streets, now visible above
    ground. This ditch, when perfect, admitted the water of the river quite
    round. Mr. Lockyer’s house is built upon subterraneous arches. They say
    here have been sixteen parish-churches, and foundations are to be found
    all the town over; and that the suburbs extended southward, especially
    on the Yeovil road, which formerly had a gate: it is not to be doubted
    but that there were gates at the passage of all the other streets. They
    say the bishop of Bath and Wells has a manuscript<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> relating to the
    ancient state of this town. They have the same tradition as in many
    other places, that the old city was set on fire by matches tied to the
    tails of sparrows, let fly from a place called Stannard-cross hill. As
    soon as I came into the inn, (the Swan) I saw a great parcel of the
    little stones of a tesselated pavement, found but two days before, in a
    garden over the way near the river: a croud of people came immediately
    out of curiosity to see it, and tore it up: I saw some of the remainder
    <em>in situ</em>, about two foot deep, laid in strong mortar upon a hard
    gravelled floor: I made the owner melancholy with informing him what
    profit he might have got by preserving it, to show to strangers. The
    Foss-way retains its name, and makes the principal street: the pavement
    thereof, or the original ford across the river, may be seen on the
    west side of the bridge, made with great flag stones. Upon the bridge
    is an old chapel, called Little St. Mary’s: at the foot of the bridge
    within the town is another, called White-chapel; both converted into
    dwellings. Foundations of houses, chimney-pieces, and the like, have
    been dug up in the meads on the west side the town, and on both sides
    the river, with stone coffins and other funeral <em>apparatus</em>. The
    head of the mayor’s staff or mace is a piece of great antiquity in cast
    brass: there are four niches with four images, two kings, a queen, and
    an angel: it seems to have been the crosier of some religious house:
    round the bottom is wrote, in two lines, <span class="antiqua">+ JESU DE DRUERJE + NEME
    DUNETMJE</span>. In the northern angle beyond the old ditch of the city,
    towards the river, have been some bastions and modern fortifications,
    of the time of king Charles I.</p>

  <p class="clear">Beyond the river is a village adjoining, called North-over, with a
    church; at Mrs. Hoddle’s, hard by, I saw a grey-hound bitch, from whose
    side a skewer of wood seven inches long had worked itself out from the
    stomach: we have some such rare cases in medicinal histories. They talk
    of a castle standing where now is the gaol, and that the tide came
    formerly up hither, though now it reaches not beyond Langport. West of
    this, some time since, they dug up some bones in a leaden case, as big
    as a band-box, laid in a hollowed stone; and near it, under a tree, was
    a vault of stone, where a body was found lying at full length. Langport
    is moted about, as they tell me, and probably was a Roman town. These
    were all the remarkables I met with at <em>Ischalis</em>, where I staid
    but half a day.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Foss <i>road</i>.</div>

  <p>Hence I continued my journey along the Foss, which I observed paved
    with the original work in many parts: it is composed of the flat
    quarry-stones of the country, of a good breadth, laid edgewise, and
    so close that it looks like the side of a wall fallen down, and
    through the current of so many ages is not worn through: a glorious
    and useful piece of industry, and, to our shame, not imitated; for
    small reparation from time to time would have preserved it intire,
    and where it is so much wanted in a dirty country. As I rode, on my
    left hand I saw the pleasant view of Montacute hill, a copped round
    eminence incompassed at bottom with a broad verge of wood, so that it
    looks like a high-crowned hat with a fringed hat-band: here has been
    a castle and chapel at top, and below it a religious house built by
    the earl of Moriton in the time of William the Conqueror.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Another
    hill near it, much of the same figure. Between them and the Foss,
    upon <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>the same hilly ridge, is a Roman camp called
    <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Hamden-hill.</span> Ro. <i>camp</i>.</span>Hamden hill, with
    a double ditch about it; to which leads a vicinal Roman way from the
    Foss through Stoke. The Foss is very plain and strait hither, and to
    Petherton bridge near South Petherton, once the palace of king Ina:<span class="sidenote">TAB. XLIV.</span>
    here was formerly a wooden bridge, but ruinous, where two children were
    drowned, as they say; whereupon their parents rebuilt it of stone, and
    caused their <em>effigies</em> to be cut upon a stone which lies at the
    foot of the bridge. In a field not far off, two years ago a pot full
    of Roman coin, to the quantity of six pecks, was dug up. Beyond this
    the Foss grows intricate and obscure, from the many collateral roads
    made through the badness and want of reparation in the true one; yet
    it seems to run through Donington, which stands on a very high hill,
    and, when mounted, presents us with a vast scene of Devonshire. I
    suppose this Foss went on the east side of Chard, and so by Axminster
    and Culliton, to Seaton or <em>Moridunum</em>, where properly it begins;
    whence if we measure its noble length to the sea-coast in Lincolnshire,
    at Grimsby or Saltfleet, where I imagine it ends, it amounts to 250
    Roman miles in a strait line from north-east to south-west. Your
    lordship presented me with an oyster, found a little northward of
    Axminster, where the very fish appears petrified with its cartilaginous
    concretion to the shell, all in their proper colours.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Chard.</div>

  <p>The street of Chard runs directly east and west, where formerly was
    kept a large market on Sundays. Beyond this to Honiton is a very bad
    road of stones and sand, over brooks, spring-heads, and barren downs.
    From the hill-tops about Stockland I first had sight of the southern
    ocean; a most solemn view, a boundless extent of water thrown into a
    mighty horizontal curve. Beyond Honiton the scene of travelling mended
    apace, and the fine Devonshire prospects entertained the eye in a
    manner new and beautiful; for here the hills are very long and broad,
    the valleys between proportional, so that the vastly-extended concavity
    presented an immense landscape of pastures and hedge-rows distinct,
    like a map of an actual survey, and not beyond ken: these are full of
    springs, brooks, and villages, copses and gentlemen’s seats; and when
    you have passed over one hill, you see the like repeated before you,
    with Nature’s usual diversity. They told me of a great kairn, or heap
    of stones, on Black down, called Lapper-stones; probably a sepulchral monument.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Isca Dumnoniorum.</span></div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. LXXIII.</div>

  <p>Exeter is the famous <i lang="la">Isca Dumnoniorum</i> of the Romans, the last
    station this way in Antoninus his Itinerary; <em>pen cair</em> of the
    Britons, the capital: it is a large and populous city, built upon
    a pleasant eminence on the eastern bank of the river <em>Ex</em>, or
    <em>Isca</em> when latinised. I suppose the original word signifies no
    more than waters, like the French <em>eaux</em>, a collection of them,
    or several rivers, or branches of rivers, running parallel; and that
    whether it be wrote <em>Ax</em>, <em>Ex</em>, <em>Ix</em>, <em>Ox</em>, or
    <em>Ux</em>; of which many instances all over England. This river is
    navigable up to the city, but the tide comes not quite so high. The
    walls take in a very great compass, being a parallelogram of 3000
    Roman feet long, 2000 broad; having a gate on every side: it lies
    oblique to the cardinal points of the compass, and objects its main
    declivity to the south-west. What adds to its wholesomeness and
    cleanliness, is that the ground is higher in a ridge along the middle
    of its length, declining on both sides: further, on the south-west
    and north-west sides it is precipicious: so that, with the river,
    the walls, the declivity of ground and ditch without side, it was a
    place of very great strength, and well chose for a frontier against
    the ancient <em>Corinavii</em>: it was built with a good omen, and has
    been ever in a flourishing condition. The walls are in pretty good
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>repair, having many lunettes and towers, and make a walk round the
    city, with the advantage and pleasure of seeing the fine country on
    the opposite hills, full of wood, rich ground, orchards, villages
    and gentlemen’s houses. The beauty of the place consists mainly of
    one long street, running the length of the parallelogram, called
    High-street, broad and strait: the houses are of a very old, but good
    model, spacious, commodious, and not inelegant: this street is full of
    shops well furnished, and all sorts of trades look brisk. The people
    are industrious and courteous: the fair sex are truly so, as well as
    numerous; their complexions, and generally their hair likewise, fair:
    they are genteel, disengaged, of easy carriage and good mien. At Mr.
    Cole’s the goldsmith I saw an old ground-plot of this city in queen
    Elizabeth’s time: there has been since a vast increase of buildings
    within and without the city: the situation renders it of necessity
    clean, dry and airy. The soil hither from Honiton was rather sandy
    than stony, whence it must needs be very healthful; and it is of a
    convenient distance from the sea. They drive a great trade here for
    woollen manufacture in cloths, serges, stuffs, &amp;c. all along the
    water-side innumerable tenters or racks for stretching them. Here is
    a good face of learning too; many booksellers’ shops: I saw a printed
    catalogue of an auction of books to be sold there. I saw the coloss
    head of the empress Julia Domna dug up near Bath, in Dr. Musgrave’s
    garden, which his father calls <em>Andromache</em>: the head-dress is
    like that of her times, and her bust at Wilton; nor is the manner and
    carving despisable: the graver has not done it justice. It is the
    noblest relique of British antiquity of this sort that we know: it is
    twenty-one inches from the top of the attire to the chin, and belonged
    to a statue of twelve foot proportion, set upon some temple or palace
    originally. In the same place is the inscription of Camillus published
    by him: I saw his library, a very good collection of books, coins and
    other antiquarian <em>supellex</em>; likewise a treatise, ready for
    publication, of the original gout, which he wrote thirty years ago,
    before his other two. The doctor had made this distemper his particular
    view through his long practice; and this country remarkably abounds
    with patients of that sort, which he attributes in a great measure to
    the custom of marling the lands with lime, and the great use of poor,
    sweet cyder, especially among the meaner people.</p>

  <p class="clear">In the northern angle of the city, and highest ground, is Rugemont
    castle, once the royal residence of the West-Saxon kings, then of
    the earls of Cornwall: it is of a squarish figure, not very large,
    environed with a high wall and deep ditch: there is a rampire of earth
    within, equal in height to the top of the wall at present, and makes
    a terrace-walk overlooking the city and country. In the morning, the
    air being perfectly serene, and the sun shining, I observed from this
    place all the country southward, between the sea and Exeter, covered
    with a very thick fog; the west side of the city and country beyond it
    very clear. In this place is the assize-house and a chapel. In the wall
    of this castle is a narrow cavity quite round, perhaps for conveyance
    of a sound from turret to turret. Dr. Holland supposes this to have
    been a Roman work originally; and it is not unlikely that it was their
    <em>prætorium</em>, or garrison. Beyond the ditch is a pleasant walk of
    trees, and a little intrenched hill, called Danes castle.</p>

  <p>The cathedral is a good pile of building: two old towers stand on
    the north and south transept of the most ancient part: the organ is
    remarkably large; the diapason pipes fifteen inches diameter, and
    set against the pillars of the church: the west front of the church
    is full of old statues. Many religious foundations in the city are
    converted into streets and houses, full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> of numerous families and
    thriving inhabitants, instead of lazy monks and nuns. King Edward I. in
    the Saxon times founded the monastery of Exeter, anno 868: Athelstan
    enlarged it for the Benedictines in 932: Edward Confessor translated
    those monks to Westminster, and made this an episcopal see; not Edward
    III. as Mr. Camden says. Leofricus a Briton was the first bishop, and
    founder of the cathedral: he was chaplain to king Edward the Confessor,
    anno 1046: he gave his lands at Bampton in Oxfordshire to this church:
    he has a monument in the southern transept. Warewast, the third bishop,
    began to build the choir, 13 Henry I. Bishop Brewer created the dean
    and prebends in the time of Henry III. Bishop Quivel built the body of
    the church to the west end, 13 Edward I. he instituted the sub-dean and
    singing-men. Bishop Grandison lengthened the cathedral by two arches,
    and is buried in a little chapel in the west end: bishop Lacy began
    the chapter-house; bishop Nevil finished it: bishop Courtney built the
    north tower, or rather repaired it, and gave that large bell called
    <em>Peter</em>: the dean and chapter built the cloysters. St. Mary’s
    chapel, at the end of the choir, is now turned into a library: this,
    I suppose, is what bishop Leofric built. The bishop’s throne in the
    choir is a lofty Gothic work. Here are many monuments of bishops in the cathedral.</p>

  <p>The present deanery, they say, was a nunnery. The monastery of St.
    Andrew at Cowic was founded by Thomas Courtney earl of Devon; a cell
    to Bec abbey in Normandy: it was dissolved in the time of Edward III.
    Roger Holland, I suppose duke of Exeter, lived in it in the time
    of Edward VI. St. Nicholas’ priory was a cell to Battle abbey: St.
    John’s was of Augustine friers: Polesloe, a mile off, dedicate to St.
    Catharine, a nunnery of the Benedictine order: Marsh was a cell to
    Plympton: Cleve was a monastery of Black canons; St. James’ priory,
    of Cluniac monks: Grey friers, without South-gate, were Franciscans;
    Gold-hays, without West-gate, Black friers: the Bear inn was the abbot
    of Tavistock’s house; the Blacklion too was a religious house; Lathbier
    another, near the new river below Radford mount. Thus had these holy
    locusts well nigh devoured the land.</p>

  <p>In Corry lane, over-against St. Paul’s church, is a little old house
    called King Athelstan’s, said to have been his palace, built of large
    square stones, and circular arches over the doors: it seems indeed to
    have been originally a Roman building, though other later works have
    been added to the doors and windows: over the door in the street is a
    very small niche crouded into the wall, as if it had been converted
    into a religious house: in the yard a winding stone stair-case is
    added. One arch of South-gate seems to be Roman. No doubt the walls of
    the city are upon the Roman foundation for the most part, and great
    numbers of antiquities have been found here. In digging behind the
    guild-hall in Pancras-lane, they found a great Roman pavement of little
    white square stones eight foot deep. A pot of Roman coin of two pecks
    was dug up, two years ago, near St. Martin’s church: I saw some of
    them in Dr. Musgrave’s possession, of Gordian, Balbinus, Philippus,
    Julia Mæsa, Geta, Gallienus, and the like. Mr. Loudham, surgeon in this
    city, has many of them among his curious collection of antiquities,
    manuscripts, &amp;c. Mr. Reynolds the schoolmaster is a great collector
    and preserver of such learned remains. St. Mary Arches church, and St.
    Stephen’s Bow, by their names seem to have been built out of Roman temples.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Nor could I think myself alone, when so much new entertainment was
    presented to me every minute. Much rock-samphire grows upon these
    cliffs. The Roman road seems to have crossed the Otter at Hertford. At
    Woodbury is a camp. I passed by Sidmouth, and came to Seaton, a little
    village upon the mouth of the river Ax. This Mr. Camden conjectures
    to have been the Roman <em>Moridunum</em>, and with reason: it has been
    a great haven and excellent port, of which they still keep up the
    memory: the river runs in a large valley, having high ground on each
    side: the shore is rocky, high and steep, consisting of the ends of
    hills which here run north and south: the ground at bottom under the
    rocks is marly; the waves wash it down perpetually, undermining the
    <em>strata</em> of stone, which from time to time fall down in great
    parcels. At present this haven mouth, which is a good half-mile over,
    is filled up with beach, as they call it; that is, coggles, gravel,
    sand, shells, and such matter as is thrown up by the roll of the
    ocean: so that the river water has but a very narrow passage on the
    east side under the cliff. The beach was covered over with <i lang="la">papaver
    luteum corniculatum</i>, now in blossom: the people in the isle of
    Portland call it <em>squat maw</em>, i. e. bruise herb, and use it in
    that case, no doubt with good success, where both intentions are
    answered, of dissolving the coagulated blood, and easing pain. On the
    west side, near Seaton, upon a little eminence is a modern ruined
    square <em>Pharos</em> built of brick; they remember it sixteen foot
    high; and two guns lie there. They say there were formerly many great
    foundations of houses visible nearer the sea than the present town, but
    now swallowed up; and in all likelihood there stood the Roman city.
    More inward toward the land, beyond the great bank of beach, is a
    marsh which the sea has made, landing itself up when its free flux was
    hindered: this is full of salt-pans, into which they take the sea-water
    at high tides. When they dig these places they find innumerable keels
    and pieces of vessels, with nails, pitch, anchors, &amp;c. six or eight
    foot deep, because it was formerly part of the haven: anchors have
    been found as high as Axminster, and beyond it, though now there is no
    navigation at all: so great a change has Time produced in the face of
    Nature, upon these confines of the two great elements always opposing each other.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Half a mile off, upon higher ground,<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Honey-Ditches.</span> <i>a Camp</i>.</span> on the western side is a castle
    in a pasture, but formerly tilled, called Honey Ditches: it is moted
    about, and perhaps walled; for they dig up much square stone there. The
    place is an oblong square, containing about three acres: I guess it to
    have been the garrison of the port. Just by the present haven-mouth is
    a great and long pier or wall, jutting out into the sea, made of great
    rocks piled together to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> the breadth of six yards. They told me it
    was built many years ago by one Courd, once a poor sailor, who, being
    somewhere in the Mediterranean, was told by a certain Greek, that much
    treasure was hid upon Hogsdon hill near here, and that this memorial
    was transmitted to him by his ancestors: Courd, upon his return digging
    there, luckily found the golden mine, which enriched him prodigiously;
    so that at his own expence he built this wall, with an intent to
    restore the harbour. The people hereabouts firmly believe the story,
    and many have dug in the place with like hopes; and as an argument of
    its truth, they say some of his family are still remaining, that live
    upon their estate got by him.</p>

  <p>A mile higher on the same western side of the river is Cullyford, where
    was the ancient road from London to Exeter passing over at Axbridge,
    which is now a stony ford, with two bridges that trathe valley
    and the river, once a haven. Here have been many inns and houses, and a
    considerable town. They talk of great stone vaults being found; so that
    it probably arose from the destruction of <em>Moridunum</em>, as Culliton
    adjacent, from it. Further, it was a corporation, and they now keep up
    their claim by an annual choice of a mayor, who has a mace too, but I
    suppose not of great elegance.</p>

  <p>Lyme lies upon the sea-side, in the cavity between two mountains, the
    <em>Londinis</em> of Ravennas according to Mr. Baxter. Here is a bold
    stony shore, the ridges of the hills jutting out into the sea; but
    broken off continually, and wasted away, by the waves as before: the
    ground too is clay and stone. Their method of opposing its violence
    is to throw out a wall of huge dry stones, which by time gathers the
    beech, and consolidates to a greater breadth. Besides, here is a great
    artificial pier, called the Cobb, extended to the length of 1000 foot
    with a bow into the ocean, where ships lie secure from the impetuous
    surges. Here are two little forts, one with five, another with three
    guns. A large sort of sea horse-tail grows plentifully upon these
    clayey cliffs; and many little springs issue thereout in the face
    of the briny deep, which loosen the earth, and hasten its continual
    downfall. I took notice that the declivity of the hills, with the veins
    of stone and different <em>strata</em> of earth in these cliffs, is ever
    north-west, just as is the appearance of the Isle of Portland hence,
    and with the same angle. The town of Lyme has a pretty good appearance.
    A small river runs in a rocky <em>alveus</em> through the middle of it
    into the sea. Most of their buildings are of a rag-stone, blue, not
    very durable. The duke of Monmouth landed at this place just by the
    pier with only twelve men: many of his party were executed on the spot
    afterwards, their limbs hung up in the town. Before that time the duke
    of Tuscany came here on shore in his visit to Britain. This is called Lime-Regis.</p>

  <p>Here entering Dorsetshire, I journeyed along the coast, in view of
    the ocean, and Portland isle growing more and more distinct, till
    I came to Bridport, a large town upon a little river. Ascending a
    high hill, I found myself upon the great downs of chalk like those
    at Salisbury, and, much to my surprize, infinitely fuller of Celtic
    barrows than your lordship’s celebrated plains. What matters of that
    sort I discovered shall be referred to another discourse. A little
    north of Bridport I found the great <span class="sidenote smcap">Icening-street.</span>Icening-street of the Romans going
    to Dorchester, which I accompanied with no small pleasure. I imagine
    it goes a little farther up the country than I had travelled, and
    hereabouts may properly be said to begin, probably meeting the Foss
    at <em>Moridunum</em>. The road from <em>Moridunum</em> westward through
    Exeter I think ought not to be denominated either from the one or the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>other, because of a different direction, which with reasonable
    allowance I esteem essential: but this road we are upon, which is the
    parallel and sister to the Foss, from Seaton to Yarmouth in Norfolk,
    extends to the like quantity of 250 Roman miles. In this place it is
    called the Ridge-way, both as it rises in an artificial ridge, and as
    it takes a high ridge all the way between here and Dorchester, having
    many valleys on both sides. The composition of the road is wholly
    of flints gathered off the lands, or taken from near the surface:
    these were laid in a fine bank, and so covered with turf. As I road
    along I found it frequently makes great curves to avoid passing over
    valleys, and industriously keeps on the highest ground, and commands
    the prospect of the country every where: it goes to <span class="sidenote smcap">Aggerdon.</span>Eggardon hill, as
    they tell me, north of Bridport; and here I suppose is a camp, whence
    the whole hundred is denominated: whether from this camp, or from
    this road, it is plain the old Latin word is retained, <em>agger</em>;
    therefore <em>aggerdon</em>, as it ought to be wrote, is the hill
    intrenched, or the down where the high road runs.</p>

  <p>The Icening-street derives its name not from beginning, but ending, at
    the Iceni, <i lang="la">via ad Icenos</i>. They say hereabouts it was cast up
    in a night’s time by the devil, referring to a supernatural agent the
    effect of Roman wisdom and industry. It enters the city of Dorchester
    by the north of Winterburn at West-gate. In divers places they have
    mended it where wore out, by a small slip of chalk and flints, with a
    shameful and degenerate carelessness; so that we may well pronounce the
    Romans worked with shovels, the moderns with tea-spoons: besides, it
    is mostly inclosed and obstructed with perpetual gates across it, to
    the great hindrance of travellers, to whom public ways ought to be laid
    open and free; and the authors of such nusances may well be declared
    sacrilegious. An endless fund of Celtic as well as Roman inquiries
    hereabouts, and no where less regarded.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Durnovaria.</div>

  <p>Dorchester, the Roman <em>Durnovaria</em>, meaning the passage over
    the river, is a good regular town, standing conformable to the four
    cardinal points, with the river on its north side: <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXVII.</span>it had four gates
    in the middle of each side, was encompassed with a strong wall and
    ditch, if not two; for so it seems, though now levelled into arable, to
    which the inhabitants hereabout are extremely prone. On the west side
    great part of the old Roman wall is standing, twelve foot thick, made
    of rag-stone, laid side by side and obliquely, then covered over with
    very strong mortar: the next course generally leans the contrary way:
    now and then three horizontal ones for binding, for much flint is used
    withal. I saw the foundation of it in a saw-pit laid upon the solid
    chalk: it is yet twelve foot high, broke through and battered every
    where, as if the sight of it was obnoxious: this is a strong manner of
    building, and very expeditious. Much more of this wall remained within
    memory. It would surprise one to think why the very ruins of it should
    be pulled down, which must be done with great labour, and frequently
    a mud wall erected in its place. The foundations appear quite round
    the town; but eastward a street is built upon it, and the ditch filled
    up: it is still called The Walls; for that way the town is swelled out
    into a considerable village, with a church and handsome tower, called
    Fordington, corruptly Farington. Here are three churches in the town
    beside it. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXVIII.</span>On the south and west side, without the walls, a handsome
    walk of trees is planted, looking pleasantly into the fields; but the
    sort of them being common sycamores, are incommodious by harbouring
    flies. The winding of the river on the north spoils the square of the
    town that way; and there is an <em>area</em> of a castle, out of the
    ruins of which the grey friers built their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> convent: but now all the
    works are wholly obliterated, religious and military. The banks of the
    river here are steep, for the town stands on high ground. Beyond the
    river are meadows and warm sandy lands; on this side, the fine chalky
    downs, pleasant for riding, and profitable in excellent grain. The air
    must needs be wholesome and pure, the climate warm, and a sufficient
    distance from the sea; so that we need not wonder if the Romans were
    fond of this place. The level of the old city was much lower than the
    present; for antiquities, which are found in great number, always
    lie deep. Some farmers were levelling another great barrow; but the
    people of Fordington rose in arms and prevented them with a laudable
    animosity. All this land is of the prince’s fee. I took notice of a
    particularity in the stone they use here: it is fetched from a quarry
    southward in the way to Weymouth; a flag-stone, rising in large
    dimensions, but not very thick: the superfice of it is curiously and
    regularly indented or waved, like a mat made of cables, and that very
    regularly: it much resembles the face of the sands upon the sea shore,
    just after the tide is gone off: it is very convenient for paving, and
    those natural undulations prevent slipperiness, being nevertheless
    level enough: they make fences for their grounds with it in many
    places, setting them up edgewise in a pretty method. The Roman money
    dug up here are called <em>dorn-pennies</em>, or king Dor’s money: the
    reverend Mr. Place, living here, showed me a great collection of them.
    Much <i lang="la">opus tessellatum</i> has been found. As this town, so Wareham
    below from its ford derives its name. In Lincolnshire we call them
    still <em>warths</em>.</p>

  <p>From Dorchester many Roman roads disperse themselves, beside the
    Icening-street, passing directly over the meadows to Walton: one goes
    by the amphitheatre southward to Weymouth; another by Poundbury,
    Stretton, to Yeovil and Ischalis; another probably to Wareham.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Poundbury</span> <i>a</i> Ro. <i>Camp</i>.</div>

  <p>Poundbury, I am intirely persuaded, was a camp of Vespasian’s, when
    he was busy hereabouts in the conquest of the <em>Belgæ</em>, therefore
    ancienter than the adjacent Roman city: the situation, the bulk, and
    the manner of it, so much resembling that by Ambsbury, engages me into
    that sentiment: it stands half a mile west of Dorchester, upon the
    brink of the river, which is very steep, in form square: the rampart
    high, but the ditch inconsiderable, except at the angle by the river;
    the reason is, because standing on high ground, they dug the earth
    clear away before it, and threw it intirely into a <em>vallum</em>; so
    that its height and steepness, wherein its strength consists, is the
    same as if a regular ditch was made in level ground. The chief entrance
    was on the south side: there seems likewise to have been an entrance
    next the river, but made with great art; for a narrow path is drawn
    all along between the edge of the precipice and the <em>vallum</em>,
    so that it was absolutely impossible to force an entry that way:
    beside, I observe, beyond the camp, for a long way, a small trench is
    cut upon the said edge, which seems designed to prevent the ascent
    of cavalry, if they should pass the river: the ground of the camp
    rises in the middle, as was usual among the Romans in their choice.
    There is a <em>tumulus</em> too, which I imagine is Celtic, and extant
    before the camp was made: this levelled a little might serve for the
    <em>prætorium</em>. A very good prospect from hence all around. The name
    is taken from its inclosure as a pound; for here they call a circle of
    stones round a <em>tumulus</em>, a pound.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Maiden Castle.</span> <i>a</i> Ro. <i>Camp</i>.</div>

  <p>The other camp, called Maiden Castle, was undoubtedly the <em>Æsiiva</em>
    of the Durnovarian garrison:<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> it is of a vast extent, and
    prodigiously strong, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>apparently of much later date than the
    foregoing, its manner savouring of inferior times of the empire:
    it has every where a double ditch of extraordinary depth, and a
    double rampire, in some places treble or more: it takes in the whole
    summit of a great hill: within it seems as if two camps, a ditch and
    <em>vallum</em> running across, with each its entry of very perplexed
    work; several ditches with cross entries lapping over one another, as
    we may well express it; especially westward, where their number may be
    affirmed half a score. Certainly, for healthful air and prospect, a
    most delightful place;</p>

  <h3><i>Of the</i> ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE <i>at</i> Dorchester.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THERE was no kind of civil edifice, or public work, more frequent among
    the Romans, in Italy or the conquered provinces, than such as related
    to sports and games; for that brave and wise people both judged and
    found that method well calculated to bring over the nations to their
    own language and customs, being agreeable contrivances that seemed
    rather pleasure and delight than compulsion. Such were theatres,
    circs, amphitheatres, <em>stadia</em>, and the like. There were three
    amphitheatres in the city of Rome; that of Vespasian, the Castrense,
    and of Statilius Taurus: and, though we find them not so particularly
    taken notice of elsewhere in historians, yet we behold the things
    themselves, whose immense bulk and weighty materials have generally so
    long out-faced time and weather. We may affirm, there was scarce any
    colony or free city, of considerable note, in their extensive empire,
    that wanted these places of public pastime; and scarce any province
    now, where their footsteps at least are not visible, and many almost
    intire, particularly what we are now treating upon, amphitheatres:
    yet I believe it will appear a novelty to most people, when we shall
    talk of such curious antiquities in Britain. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXI. XCVII.</span>But since this time
    twelve-months, I have seen three, one at Silchester, another at
    Richborough castle in Kent, and this at Dorchester in Dorsetshire. I
    have been told of one with six tire of seats, three mile off Redruth
    in Cornwall. Sir Christopher Wren is the first person that I know of
    who gave this hint of inquiry, in discovering this, many years ago,
    in his journeys to the isle of Portland, when he began to build St.
    Paul’s cathedral. Great pity it is that he did not take an exact
    description of it at that time, when in greater perfection, before
    the gallows were removed hither by an unlucky humour of the sheriff;
    since when the parapet at top is on that side much beaten down, by the
    trampling of men and horses at executions; but especially because his
    great skill might have done it exact justice, and by means of his pen
    it might have shared in the duration of his works. In defect of such
    illustration, I hope the reader will accept of my mean endeavours to
    preserve so valuable a piece of architecture, which, notwithstanding
    the damage above mentioned, and that the <em>area</em> of it has been
    ploughed up these many years, will still give a spectator a fine notion
    in the structures of this sort abroad, deservedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> the admiration of
    travellers; and will present a person of understanding, the pleasure of
    observing the noble and great genius of the Romans in every production
    of their hands. Nor does the meanness of its materials debase, but
    rather inhance, its value and its art; for, though less costly and
    lasting than stone and marble, of which others are generally built, yet
    for the same reason less liable to rapine, and the covetous humour of
    such as plunder them for other uses: therefore I believe, in the main,
    it is as perfect as most abroad, if not so alluring to the eye; whence
    we may suppose it has so long escaped common observation, though close
    by a great town and road.</p>

  <p>An amphitheatre is properly a double theatre, or two theatres joined
    together. A theatre is a semicircle wherein are the seats of the
    spectators; the <em>apparatus</em> of the actors, or scenes, filling
    up the diameter before it. But if we would be more exact, we shall
    observe, it is half as long again as the <em>radius</em>; for they cut
    off the fourth part of a circle, then the rest became the form of their
    theatres. Now two such as these joined together, throwing away the
    scenic part, constituted an amphitheatre; taking its name from circular
    vision, and because the seats were continued quite round, the faces of
    the people being all directed to the centre of its excentricity: so its
    use required, different from that of the theatre, where the company
    look all one way toward the stage. But then, as Lipsius takes notice
    in discoursing upon this topic, the lines, at the ends where they are
    conjoined, must be drawn outward a little, approaching more to strait
    lines, than it becomes a true oval, well expressed by Cassiodorus;
    “for, (says he) the <em>area</em> includes the figure of an egg, which
    affords due space for combatants, and more advantage to spectators to
    see every thing by its long curvity or relaxed circle.” These were
    not put in practice at Rome till the end of the commonwealth, and
    appropriated to the hunting and fighting of wild-beasts, to gladiators
    and the like; and at last to sea engagements, represented in gallies
    floating upon the water, which they introduced for that purpose.
    First of all, they made them <em>pro tempore</em> of timber, being two
    theatres, each fixed upon a wonderful <em>axis</em>, and so contrived,
    that when they pleased they could turn both together, with all the
    people on their seats, and make an amphitheatre; of which Pliny, xxxv.
    15. speaks with a note of astonishment, as it really was. This was
    done by C. Curio, one of Cæsar’s party. It is worth while to read the
    great naturalist’s descant upon it. This I suppose gave occasion to
    the building of regular amphitheatres, of which Cæsar made the first
    in the <em>Campus Martius</em>, but of wood, when he was dictator. The
    first of stone was erected in Augustus his time, by Statilius Taurus,
    in the place of the former, which was the only one till Vespasian,
    whose work was the monstrous <em>Colissæum</em>, but finished by his son
    Titus. This has afforded materials for many public buildings in Rome,
    and still boasts its immense ruins, as one of the greatest prodigies of
    the imperial city.</p>

  <p>Vitruvius mentions nothing of amphitheatres; therefore he probably
    published his book before that of Taurus was built: as for Cæsar’s, it
    belonged not to masonry, being carpenter’s work; in which he was a very
    great master, as in every thing else: so that we must form our notions
    of these things from the works themselves, and the ruins that time
    has spared. The parts of an amphitheatre are these: the <em>arena</em>
    or space within, the scene of action; the <em>euripus</em>, or river
    that generally encompassed the verge of it; the <em>podium</em>, or
    parapet at bottom; the <em>itinera</em>, or <em>viæ</em>, which were the
    walks between certain series of seats; the <em>ascensus</em>, steps or
    stairs; the <em>pulpita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></em> or <em>tribunalia</em>, a sort of covered
    chair of state, where the emperor, his legate, the prætor or chief
    magistrate of a city, sat; the <em>cathedræ</em>, where the senators,
    foreign ambassadors, and great personages, sat; the <em>gradus</em>, or
    common seats; the <em>præcinctiones</em>, which I suppose balustrades;
    the <em>aditus</em> or <em>vomitoria</em>, being the passages from the
    stairs withinside to the seats, a metaphorical name, from the people
    pouring themselves through them with violence; the <em>cunei</em>, which
    were the space of seats comprehended between two of those passages, so
    called from their wedge-like shape; the <em>porticus</em>, or galleries
    within, partly for magnificence, and partly for convenience: all these
    particulars are easily apprehended from inspection of schemes and
    sections of these works in many authors. Some of them could not, others
    need not to be in our work; therefore I shall occasionally enlarge
    upon those pertinent to this subject, as they fall in our way in the description.</p>

  <p class="clear"><span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXVII.</span>The amphitheatre at Dorchester is situate on a plain in the open
    fields about a quarter of a mile (being just 300 of my paces) or 1500
    foot south-west from the walls of the town, delicately ascending all
    the way, close by the Roman road running from thence to Weymouth. The
    vulgar call it Maumbury, but have no notion of its purpose, though
    it is a common walk for the inhabitants, and the terrace at top is a
    noted place of rendezvous, as affording a pleasant circular walk, and
    a prospect of the town and wide plain of corn fields all around, much
    boasted of by the inhabitants for most excellent grain. Westward of the
    town we see the Roman camp called Poundbury, and southward the most
    famous one Maiden castle, both before described. More southerly all the
    hill-tops, as far as the eye reaches, are covered with an incredible
    number of Celtic barrows. It stands upon the very edge of that part of
    the fields which declines gently northward, or toward the town, upon a
    chalk, and which without doubt at first was perfect down, like that of
    Salisbury plain, or the neighbouring downs in the way to Bridport. One
    may in fancy imagine the beauty of its prospect, and the pleasantness
    of the walk hither upon that fine carpet, when all was in its first
    perfection; but at present it is ploughed up to the very skirt of the
    amphitheatre, both within and without: <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXVIII.</span>so foolishly greedy are the
    country people of an inch of ground, that they have levelled several
    barrows lately in the neighbourhood, which cost more than the spot they
    covered will pay in fifty years. This work of ours is raised of solid
    chalk upon the level, without any ditch about it. I have endeavoured to
    delineate, as exactly as I could by mensuration, the true and original
    ground-plot thereof, or architectonic design upon which it is formed,
    from what is left by the injuries of age, of the plough, of men and
    beasts; and that in its first and genuine scale the Roman foot, which
    is about an eleventh part less than ours. The <span class="sidenote">TAB. L.</span><a href="#i_165">plate N<sup>o</sup> 50</a>, represents
    the amphitheatre as covered with the <em>subsellia</em>, and as in its
    primitive perfection; for we may well suppose age has diminished it on
    all dimensions: and in truth it requires a great deal of thought and
    judgement to attempt to measure it. It is obvious thence to observe,
    in the general, its conformity with other works of this sort abroad,
    as far as its different materials will allow; and the great judgement
    of the architect in varying his scheme thereto, so as fully to answer
    the proposed end. It is to be noted that half this work is above,
    and half below the surface of the ground, as<span class="sidenote">TAB. LIII.</span> visible in a section;
    so that great part of the matter was dug out of the <em>cavea</em> in
    the middle; for it is a solid bed of chalk, and the rest fetched from
    elsewhere. I believe the method of building it, was to join solid chalk
    cut square like stones, and that mortar made of burnt chalk was run
    into the joints; and probably all the outside was neatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> laid with
    scantlings of the same, but with the natural turf on: so that it is not
    much inferior in strength to those of stone, though infinitely less
    expensive; but for use and convenience there is very little difference;
    and as to beauty, as far as relates to the seats, and what was visible
    on the inside, our work no doubt was very handsome, and even now is a
    very pleasant sight. It is observed of most amphitheatres abroad, that
    they are placed without the cities for wholesomness, and upon elevated
    ground for benefit of the air, and perflation; a thing much recomended
    for theatres in Vitruvius; as that of Bourdeaux, 400 paces without
    the city. Besides, this is very artfully set upon the top of a plain,
    declining to the north-east; whereby the rays of the sun, falling upon
    the ground hereabouts, are thrown off to a distance by reflection, and
    the upper end of the amphitheatre, for the major part of the day, has
    the sun behind the spectators.</p>

  <p>When you stand in the centre of the entrance, it opens itself with all
    the grandeur that can be imagined: the jambs are wore away somewhat,
    and the plough encroaches on its verge every year, especially the
    cheeks below: never did I see corn growing, which of itself is an
    agreeable sight, with so much indignation as in this noble concavity,
    where once the <em>gens togata</em>, and majesty of imperial Rome, used
    to show itself. The conjugate, or shortest diameter externally, is to
    the longest as 4 to 5; that of the <em>area</em> within, as 2 to 3: this
    is the same proportion as of the amphitheatre at Lucca, which is 195
    <em>brachia</em> in length, 130 broad: a <em>brachium</em> is about 23½ of
    our inches: it is 25 high. In ours therefore the two centres upon the
    transdiameter, or longest that form it, are 100 feet distant:
    the ends of the oval are struck with a <em>radius</em> of 60 feet set
    upon each of those centres. The centres that describe the side-lines
    are formed by setting off 85 feet on each side the diameter, from the
    centre of excentricity. Thus from these four centres only the whole
    is delineated, and that most easily and naturally; whence I suspect
    Desgodetz, in laying down his plot of the <em>Coliseum</em>, has without
    necessity employed no less than eight centres, which is an operation
    of great perplexity: but still we except the circle in the middle,
    which so remarkably distinguishes this from all other works, and which
    gives so great a beauty to the scheme: this is that artful contrivance
    supplying the place of portico’s, stair-cases, <em>vomitoria</em>, and
    all the costly work in the grander amphitheatres, for ready conveyance
    of the spectators in and out to their proper places: it is described
    from the common centre of the whole, and in the ground-plot is a
    true circle; but upon the place becomes a walk of eight foot broad,
    gradually ascending, from the ends upon the long diameter, to its
    highest elevation in the middle upon the short diameter, where it
    reaches half-way up the whole series of seats of the spectators, who
    marching hence distribute themselves therein from all sides without
    hurry and tumult. On the top is a terrace twelve feet broad at least,
    beside the parapet outwardly five feet broad, four high. There are
    three ways leading up to this; at the upper end of the work, over the
    cave, one; and one on each side upon the shortest diameter, going from
    the elevated part of the circular walk: horses very conveniently,
    several a-breast, may go upon this, and frequently do, ascending by
    the ruin of the cave, but not on the outward steep. The parapet is now
    three or four foot high, but much ruined on that side next the gallows
    since last year, at an execution: not only so, but I saw a mixen heap
    laid under it on that side; and some vile fellow had been digging down
    part of the amphitheatre to lay among it for compost. There is some
    enormity, if one examines this work in mathematical strictness without
    proper judgement: because it stands on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> a declivity, some parts
    of the out-side are higher than others, not only as to the same side,
    but as to the same part on different sides: the plain on which it
    stands, declines to the north-east: hence the outer side of the work
    is higher there than in other places; therefore in my sections and
    ground-plot I endeavour to reduce it to a medium, and the measure which
    seems to have been the primary intent of the architect.</p>

  <p>The cave, or receptacle of the gladiators, wild beasts, &amp;c. I suppose
    to have been at the upper end, under the ascent to the terrace, being
    vaults under that part of the body of the work: whether they were of
    the same chalk, or timber, or whether they were arched with brick
    or stone, or what other matter, I cannot say; but the ruin thereof
    seems to be the reason of the present deformity at that end; so that
    it is not easy to guess at its original profile. We may observe that
    the parapet and terrace go back there, and, taking a new sweep, fall
    beyond the line of the outer oval; for two reasons, as I conceive:
    1st, Because by that means there is a greater length obtained for the
    ascent to the terrace, which makes it more gradual and easy: 2dly,
    Thereby more space is procured for the apartments of the prisoners
    under ground. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LIII.</span>By the section lengthwise, it is easily understood that
    I suppose a passage quite through, or subterraneous gallery upon that
    end of the longest diameter,<span class="sidenote">TAB. XLII. 2d Vol.</span> under the ascent to the terrace, from
    the out-side into the <em>area</em>: this must open at the bottom of
    the <em>podium</em>, as was practised in other works of like nature,
    with a squarish door, as Varro tells us, <em>de re rustica</em>. “The
    door (says he) ought to be low and narrow, of that sort which they
    call a <em>cochlea</em>, as is wont to be in the cave where the bulls
    are shut up for fight.” The entrance to this place might be from
    without-side the amphitheatre: here is no want of room for the door
    within; for the level of the <em>area</em> was at least twelve feet
    lower than the <em>podium</em>, like our pit at the play-houses; and it
    is probable there was a descent of the whole level this way, to draw
    off the rain into some subterraneous passage: the <em>podium</em> in the
    <em>castrensian</em> amphitheatre is monstrously high. Our <em>area</em>,
    no doubt, is exceedingly elevated by manuring, ploughing, and ruins:
    yet it preserves a dish-like concavity, through innumerable injuries;
    for the descent from the entrance is very great, and you go down as
    into a pit. I conjecture the middle part of the <em>area</em> is now
    ten foot lower than the level of the field: but the field itself,
    especially about the entrance, is much lowered by ploughing, because
    the end of the circular walk there, which should be even with the
    ground, is a good deal above it. The dens and caves of the wild beasts
    at the great circ in Rome were only of earth and wood, till Claudius
    the emperor built them of marble. This ruin at the upper end is very
    considerable; for it has so filled the <em>arena</em> thereabouts, that
    the cattle plough up to the very <em>præcinctio</em>. On the out-side is
    a large round tumour, a considerable way beyond the exterior verge,
    and regular in figure, which certainly has been somewhat appertaining
    to the work: I could wish that a careful person had liberty of digging
    into it. Moreover, this <em>podium</em> had a parapet of earth, if not
    a balustrade, as was usual in others: behind this, upon the lowermost
    seat, was the place of the senators and chief persons, who often had
    chairs or cushions: this was the best place for seeing and hearing, as
    being nearest the <em>arena</em>; whence Juvenal says,</p>

  <p class="noindent">So Suetonius, in <cite>Augusto</cite>, says, the senate made an order, that
    the first or lowest seat at public spectacles should be left for them:
    probably this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> broader than any other seat, with a greater space
    between the <em>podium</em> and next seat, for more ease. The chair of
    state for the <em>prætor</em> was on one side, and probably another
    opposite to it for the emperor, or his legate, which was reserved
    empty, for state, in their absence; or for the <em>editor</em> of the
    shows, who was generally thus distinguished: and it is remarkable
    that a little prominence is still left in these very places. These
    were set in the middle of the <em>podium</em>, on each side, upon the
    shortest diameter, and were covered with canopies like a tabernacle.
    This <em>podium</em> had, for greater safety, grates, nets, and lattice
    work of iron, or more costly metal, supported by pillars, and the like:
    beside, there were rollers of wood or ivory length-wise, which hindered
    the beasts from climbing up, by their turning round, as is particularly
    described by Calpurnius. And, moreover, in greater amphitheatres,
    there was a ditch full of water under it, called <em>euripus</em>, first
    introduced by Julius Cæsar. In the early times of these buildings,
    the people sat all together promiscuously; but after the emperors,
    the places were distinguished according to the degrees of quality,
    senators, knights, or common people. The knights seats were next to the
    senators, fourteen deep in number; so that <i lang="la">gradus quatuordecim</i>
    became a phrase for the equestrian order. We may suppose these two
    degrees filled all the seats in our amphitheatre under the circular
    walk or ascent. The common people possessed the remainder, or the whole
    concavity above the circular walk, taking the best places as they came
    first: but the uppermost seats were reserved particularly for the
    women; and one reason of their distance was, I suppose, because the
    gladiators were naked. And that no routs and confusions should disturb
    the order of these solemnities, there were proper officers appointed,
    that took care none should presume to sit out of the seats suitable to
    his degree.</p>

  <p>I imagine the terrace at top in our work was designed for the men
    of arms: for they are by no means to be excluded, seeing one of the
    primary intents of these diversions was to inure them, as well as the
    people, to blood and murder. Hence, before they went upon any great
    expedition, or foreign war, these feasts and butcheries were publicly
    celebrated: and in my opinion, the two rising plots, that are squarish
    on each side upon the shortest diameter, were for the officers. These
    are above the level of the walk, or terrace, and might possibly have a
    tent set upon them for that purpose. I call them pavilions: they are
    of a handsome turn, and capable each of holding two dozen of people
    commodiously: their side-breadth is fifteen foot; their length, i. e.
    north and south, twenty: they are somewhat nearer the upper end, not
    standing precisely upon the shortest diameter, and four foot above the
    level of the terrace. I considered with care that seeming irregularity
    of the terrace on both sides the lower end; for it is higher within
    side than without, yet so as to produce no ill effect below, either
    within or without, but the contrary. I find it is a master-piece of
    skill, and am surprised that it has not been more defaced in so long
    time. The matter is this: the work standing on a declining plain, this
    artifice was necessary to render its appearance regular; for when you
    stand in the centre within-side, the whole circuit of the terrace
    seems and is really of one level: but on the out-side the verge of
    the north-easterly part is sloped off gradually toward the entrance
    where the declivity is, conformably with it; whence the whole exterior
    contour appears of an equal height too: and this could not otherwise
    have been obtained, since within it was necessary to keep a true level,
    without regard to the outer plain. As to the seats, which I have
    supposed in <a href="#i_165">plate 50</a>, they were contrived to be twice as broad as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
    high: their height was but a small matter more than a foot, and their
    breadth not above two feet and a half; half that space being allotted
    for the seat of the lowermost, and the other half for the feet of the
    uppermost. The declivity of these <em>gradus</em> is justly made within
    an angle of thirty degrees, the third part of a quadrant: but this is
    more exact at the ends; for in the middle, or towards the shortest
    diameter over the elevated part of the circular walk, the upper
    <em>series</em> of seats has a somewhat more obtuse angle; the reason
    of which is obvious, to overlook the breadth of the circular walk.
    This is most plainly seen in the sections, and is done with judgement,
    because by that means the upper edge of the amphitheatre is in a right
    line with the declivity. As to the disposition of these seats, their
    method is as new as curious: it is so contrived, that the circular
    walks cut the whole breadth in two equal parts upon the shortest
    diameter; therefore an equal number of seats is above and under it:
    hence the middle seat at each extremity is in the same level with the
    elevated part of the walk. Though these seats in other amphitheatres
    abroad were made of stone or marble, yet they were generally covered
    with boards, because more wholesome; and that sometimes covered with
    cushions for the better sort. Dion Cassius tells us, this piece of
    nicety was first brought in by Caligula, who gave cushions to the
    senators seats, that they might not sit upon the bare boards, and
    <em>Thessalic</em> caps to keep them from the sun. The vulgar had mats
    made of reeds. I think we may well infer from hence, that the seats in
    our amphitheatre were covered too with plank, if not made wholly of
    it. The <em>præcinctiones</em>, or, as Vitruvius sometimes calls them in
    Greek, <em>diazomata</em>, which commentators make a difficulty about,
    to me seem only balustrades, because he orders them to be as high as
    the breadth of the walk along them: beside that upon the <em>podium</em>,
    here might possibly be one upon the inner edge of the terrace which
    separated between the soldiers and the women.</p>

  <p>The <em>area</em> in the middle was commonly called <em>arena</em>, from
    the sand it was strown over with, for the better footing of the
    combatants, and to drink up the blood: this again by intervals was
    fresh strown, or raked over, to prevent slipperiness; for if, instead
    thereof, the pavement had been brick or stone, it would have proved
    highly inconvenient. Hence this word became a common appellation
    of an amphitheatre, and most of those beyond sea are still called
    <em>arena</em>. As for the present name of <em>Maumbury</em>, perhaps it
    comes corrupted from the old British word <em>mainge</em>, signifying
    <em>scamnum</em>, <em>scabellum</em>, the same as our bench, from the
    multitude of seats therein; the remains of which in former times might
    very plausibly give occasion to such an appellation. Or is it not
    equivalent to the heathen <em>bury</em>, from the memory of these pagan
    sports therein celebrated? as our ancestors used to call heathenism by
    the general name of <em>maumetry</em>, corrupted from <em>mahometism</em>:
    of this my friend Robert Stephens, esq; J. C. first gave me the hint.
    Thus in Trevisa’s translation of <em>Polychronicon</em>, XIV. 18. p. 175.
    “Julianus had commaunded that crysten knyghtes sholde do sacrefyce
    to <em>mawmettes</em>,” meaning heathen idols. Or is it from the
    old-fashioned games of <em>mummings</em>, so frequent among us, derived
    from <em>Mimus</em> or <em>Momus</em>? The <em>Mimi</em> were frequently
    introduced into all shows, at theatres, amphitheatres, circs, &amp;c. Or
    perhaps in the same sense it is to be understood as in Oxfordshire
    they call land <em>maum</em>, consisting of a mixture of white clay and
    chalk, Plot’s hist. p. 240. The <em>area</em> was originally about 140
    feet diameter the shortest way, 220 the longest; wherein it falls not
    much short of the compass of the most considerable ones. The famous
    amphitheatre at Verona<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> but 233, and 136; and the vast <em>Colisæum</em>
    at Rome is but 263, 165; but, I believe, as reckoned by a larger
    measure, the French foot. That at Perigusium is less than ours, being
    180 one way, 120 the other. I find the amphitheatre at Silchester is of
    the same dimension with ours here, and built of the same materials and
    form, as far as I could discern, but more ruinous.</p>

  <p>These places, though of absolute necessity open at top, where usually
    sheltered from rain in some measure, and from the sun effectually, by
    great sail-cloths spread along the top from masts and ropes, which
    were managed by the soldiers of the marine affairs, who were more
    skilful in such work: a fashion first invented by Q. Catulus when he
    was Ædile. The places where these poles were let through the cornices
    of the upper order, and rested on corbels, are still visible in the
    great amphitheatres. This probably was done in ours by masts and poles
    fastened into the ground without-side, and leaning along the outside
    bank; which would give them a very advantageous turn in hanging over
    the top of the theatre; for the slope of the <em>agger</em> externally
    is with an angle of forty five degrees, being half a right angle, the
    most natural and commodious for beauty and force to oppose against
    the side weight: or they might erect them in the solid work on the
    top of the terrace, seeing it has abundantly strength enough. But in
    the particularity of these modes no certainty is at this time to be
    expected. However, by the situation of the place, the architect has
    taken great care, according to Vitruvius his rules about theatres, to
    obviate the inconvenience of the sun-beams as well as possible; and
    that in three respects. 1st, As he has set it upon a plain declining
    northwards, and upon the higher part of the plain; upon the very tip
    where the declivity begins. 2dly. By taking the bearing of it exactly,
    I found the opening, or entrance thereto, is to the north-east precise:
    hence it is very plain and easy to conceive, that from nine o’clock
    in the morning till sun-set, in the longest day of the year, the sun
    will be on the backs of the spectators, upon the upper or south-west
    half of the building; which contrivance is worthy of notice: and that
    this is not done upon account of the city of Dorchester lying that way,
    but as a thing essential, is plain from the like in the amphitheatre
    of Silchester, which opens upon the same point, though directly the
    farthest from the city. 3dly, The breadth of the opening or entrance,
    level with the surface, and opposite to the falling beams of the sun,
    must produce a very great rebatement of the heat thereof, reflected
    into this vast concave, and prove a convenience the other amphitheatres
    are wholly destitute of: and this purpose is so much regarded, that,
    if we consider it with a scrupulous eye, we shall find that the
    western side of this upper half of the terrace and the pavilion there
    is somewhat broader, and nearer the upper end of the long diameter,
    than the eastern. In the midway of the terrace between the pavilions
    on both sides and the <em>cavea</em>, are still to be seen two round
    holes, which seem to be places where they set poles to oppose against
    those others leaning on the out-side that bear the sail-cloths. The
    section or profile of this work is contrived with exquisite judgement
    in proportioning its parts; for the eye of a man standing at the most
    retired part of the terrace next the parapet is in the right line of
    the declivity within side; of a man standing in the middle of it, his
    eye sees the heads of the spectators sitting under him on the upper
    <em>subsellia</em>, even with the line of the circular walk; the eye of
    him standing on the edge of the terrace, sees the heads of those on the
    lowermost <em>subsellia</em>, even with the edge of the <em>podium</em>,
    and commands the whole <em>area</em>: therefore we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> conclude none
    were permitted to stand on the circular walk, for that would have
    obstructed the sight, but it was left open for passage. I took notice
    before, that on both sides, the terrace at the top of the lower half
    seemed to me narrower than that at the other and principal half:
    whether so originally, and for sake of any advantage to be had in this
    respect, and that the meanest of the people stood here, or that it has
    happened to have been more wasted away since, I cannot be positive;
    but I judged it not material enough to be regarded in the scheme: for,
    in the main, I found the breadth of the side of the work, or solid,
    taken upon the ground-plot, is equal to half the longest diameter
    of the <em>area</em>, or a fourth of the whole longest diameter. Its
    perpendicular altitude, from the top of the terrace to the bottom of
    the <em>area</em>, is a fourth of the longest diameter of the <em>area</em>.</p>

  <p>In the middle of each side we may observe a <em>cuneus</em>, or parcel of
    the seats, of near thirty feet broad, just over the most elevated part
    of the circular work, and reaching up to the terrace, which swells out
    above the concavity of the whole, and answering to the rising ground
    in the middle of the terrace, which we call the pavilions, and have
    assigned for the seats of the officers among the soldiery. This is upon
    the shortest diameter, and over the <em>tribunalia</em> of the emperor
    and prætor; and consequently cuts each side of the upper <em>series</em>
    of seats above the circular walk into two equal parts. I have guessed
    only at these reasons for it, which I leave to better judgements. One
    might possibly be, to give a greater beauty to the range of seats over
    the circular walk by its break, which is a thing not practised at all
    in other amphitheatres, unless we suppose this effect produced by their
    <em>vomitoria</em>: or is it not more necessary here, because of the
    circular walk, which causes the <em>series</em> of seats above them to
    be broader at the extremity than in the middle, and therein different
    from the aspect of common amphitheatres? Or was not this division
    useful in distinguishing the great length of that <em>series</em> into
    separate compartments for two different sort of plebeians? Or is it
    necessary to distribute the three orders of people; the senators under
    the circular walk to the <em>podium</em>, whose place in general was
    called <em>orchestra</em>; that half of the upper seats on the upper or
    south side of this protuberant part, to the equestrian order; that on
    the lower or north side, to the people or vulgar? But there seems to
    be another likely reason, that every seat here was divided into two
    (at least some part of it) in the nature of steps, as was practised
    in particular places of all other amphitheatres: and perhaps there
    were three of these ranges of steps, one in the middle, and one on
    each side: that in the middle was for the officers to ascend from the
    circular walk to their tribunals, or tents, set upon the raised part of
    the terrace, whilst the common soldiers went up by the ascent over the
    cave, at the upper end. The steps on each side led to the respective
    halves of the upper <em>series</em> of seats above the circular walk. All
    which uses to me appear convenient and necessary for ease, regularity,
    and decency. In the upper or south-west half of the internal slope have
    been some deformities, caused by the inner edge of the terrace in some
    places cut or fallen down, which spoils the curve a little: and, as the
    lower terraces diminish gradually from the pavilions to the entrance,
    that on the western end has received great damage over and above; for
    the inward verge of it has been thrown down intirely: as for that
    north-easterly half of the terrace, which we said was narrower, more
    exposed to the sun, and for that reason allotted to the last rabble,
    we leave them to scramble up with somewhat more labour over the whole
    <em>series</em> of the seats at that end, which we may reasonably judge
    were last filled by the spectators.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

  <p>These noble buildings, which were of a fine invention, and well
    calculated for their uses, were most frequently called, from their
    hollow figure, <em>cavea</em>; of which there are many quotations to
    be had out of the old poets, and other writers: and originally it
    was inherent to theatres; in which sense commonly used by Cicero and
    others, but at length passed chiefly to amphitheatres, as the greater
    works. The matter of some was brick, as that near Trajecto in the
    Campania of Italy; another at Puteoli; others stone, and others solid
    marble; as that famous one at Capua, another at Athens, and that at
    Verona. The amphitheatre which is still in part to be seen at Pola in
    Istria, was of stone and wood too; for the whole frame of the seats
    was made of timber, the portico’s only, or external part, of stone.
    The wit of man could not find out a fitter scheme for commodiousness
    of seeing and hearing: and in some respect, I conceit, they had an eye
    to the form of their harps, fiddles, and such instruments of music,
    as modulate sounds in a roundish cavity: the oval turn thereof, and
    the solidity of the materials, had all the requisites of receiving and
    returning the vibrations of the air to greater advantage. Vitruvius
    advises, in this case, that the place, as well as the stuff, wherein
    these buildings are set, and of which they are composed, must not be
    what he calls <em>surd</em>, such as deaden the sound, but make smart
    repercussions, and in just space of time; which is of great consequence
    in the philosophy of echoes: for if the voice strike upon a solid
    that is not harmonious in its texture, that is, whose parts are not
    of a proper tone or tenseness, not consentaneous to the vibrations of
    musical notes; or if this solid be too near, or too far distant, so
    that it reverberates too quick, or too slow, as a room too little, or
    too great; all the main business of hearing and sounds is disturbed.
    Vitruvius is very large upon this head, to whom I refer the reader.
    Now I suppose the ancients learnt by experience and trial, as well
    as by reasoning upon the nature of things, that such a capacity and
    compass, and of such extent, was best for this end: whence we find,
    that all their amphitheatres are much about the same bulk, and executed
    upon nearly the same proportions. A thing of this kind deceives the
    eye without strict consideration; for it is bigger than it seems, and
    a person in the middle of it, to one upon the terrace, looks lesser
    than one would imagine. It is true indeed, that ours is not made of
    so solid materials as brick, stone or marble; but yet it is possible
    there may be as much an error in one extreme as the other, and nature
    affects a mediocrity. One shall scarce doubt that a <em>convallis</em>,
    or proper convexity between two mountains, will give as fine an echo
    as any artificial work that can be contrived. I can say, however, in
    favour of the subject we are upon, that in effect it has a very fine
    and agreeable sound, (as I purposely several times tried) and seems
    to want nothing of the compactness of matter, or closeness of the
    place, though doubtless much deficient in the original depth, which
    would improve it. An echo here is not to be expected, the return being
    too quick; but after the voice you hear a ringing, as of a brass pot,
    or bell; which shows the proportion well adjusted: and perhaps, if
    we consider the great numbers of the stair-cases and openings, or
    what they call <em>vomitoria</em>, in the other amphitheatres, for the
    people to come in and go out at, which are intirely wanting here; we
    may not be far to seek for the reason of it, or scruple thinking ours
    to be the better model: the sides being perfectly uniform, and free
    from those frequent apertures, seem better adapted for the rolling,
    concentring, and retorting the voice. It is not unlikely that some
    may think the great gap and discontinuity of our entrance an obstacle
    in the case; but to such I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> would propose a <em>quære</em>, Whether
    that single break, which bears so small a proportion to the whole, in
    account of those best skilled in the doctrine of <em>acoustics</em>, be
    not by far more inconsiderable in that point, than the multiplicity
    of those other passages which we see in all drawings of this kind?
    Or whether again it be not a real advantage to the sound? as is the
    hole in the sounding-board of a fiddle, harp, harpsichord, or the
    like instrument; or when two holes are made, as frequently; but, if
    there were twenty instead thereof, probably it would be injurious,
    though of less bulk when all put together. Perhaps the air intirely
    pent up in this great hollow, without any collateral aperture, may be
    obstructed in the varieties of its necessary motions and reflections,
    so as to delight the ear: and I must profess myself of this opinion,
    which seems confirmed by Nature’s abhorrence of such figures, in the
    constant outlets of valleys some way or other. It is certain, whatever
    effect the entrance has as to the sound, it must be highly useful in
    cooling the place, in admitting the breezes of the north-easterly air
    from over the meadows to refresh them; and the side of the opposite
    hill beyond the town, diversified with hedge-grows, presents a
    beautiful scene to the better spectators: nor is the present town
    deficient in contributing to the landscape: for, as you advance from
    the <em>arena</em> toward the entrance, the two handsome towers of the
    churches appear very agreeably at each cheek of the entrance.</p>

  <p>But we have reason to content ourselves with the plain matter of
    fact, and need not enter into a dispute, whether necessity or choice
    determined the Romans here to use the present materials, or whether the
    entrance was originally of the manner we see it: it is certain, that in
    all the places where I have seen these amphitheatres, the Roman walls
    that incompassed the towns are still left, built with ranges of brick,
    stone, flint, and indissoluble mortar; so that ignorance of building
    cannot be laid to their charge. Nor is this practice wholly confined
    to our island, and without parallel; for there is now in France an
    amphitheatre, not improperly to be reckoned of this sort, whereof
    Lipsius gives us a large account: it is at a place called Doveon, near
    Pont du sey, upon the river Loire, as you go from Anjou to Poictou; a
    place where the Druids are said to have had a seat: this is cut out
    of a mountain of stone, but of a very soft kind, and, I suppose, not
    much better than our chalk: it is not near so big as ours, and much
    inferior in beauty and convenience: here are chambers hewn out of the
    rock for the caves; and the <em>area</em> is but very small. The seats
    of the theatre of Bacchus at Athens are still visible, cut out of the
    natural rock. It is not much to be doubted, that in many places in
    France, and other provinces of the Roman empire, where the same chalk
    is the soil, there are such as ours, though as little regarded: and
    we may reasonably think, in the beginning of the commonwealth, before
    art, luxury, and magnificence had got to its highest pitch, that the
    Romans themselves were contented with such of grassy turf. The people
    of Rome originally stood at the games. Cicero, <em>de Amicit.</em> c.
    7. says, <i lang="la">stantes plaudebant in re ficta</i>. So Tac. <em>Annal.</em>
    XIV. 20. “If you look back to customs of antiquity, the people stood
    at the shows; for if they had been accommodated with seats, they would
    have idled the whole day away at the theatre.” Valer. Max. XI. 4. says,
    “it was ordered by the senate, that no one should set benches for
    shows in the city, nor within a mile of it, or should see the games
    sitting, that the manly posture of standing, the peculiar note of the
    Roman nation, should be observed even at diversions.” If any one had
    rather think, that ours never had any seats, but that the people stood
    upon the plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> grassy declivity, I shall not be ato it, and the
    rather because it is your lordship’s opinion: yet it seemed to me,
    viewing the sides very curiously, when the sun shone upon them with a
    proper light and shade, that I could see the very marks of the poles
    that lay upon the slopes, whereon the benches were fastened. Ovid,
    <i lang="la">de arte amandi</i>, speaking of theatres, says the seats were turf.</p>

  <p class="noindent">This of ours seems to be a better method than that in the amphitheatre
    at Pola; and, if it is readily owned much inferior to those at Rome,
    yet even those were exceeded by the noble Greek architects, especially
    by that most admirable theatre near the temple of Æsculapius in
    Epidaurus, of which Pausanias, an eye-witness of both, speaks <em>in
    argolicis</em>: “for, though it is not so big as some others, yet for
    the art of it, the nicety of its constituents, and for beauty, who dare
    contend with Polycletus, who was the architect of it?” says he.</p>

  <p>As it is not my intent to write a complete history of amphitheatres,
    or further than what is necessary to our present purpose, and to give
    a clear understanding of our work; so I forbear saying any thing of
    the manners, times, qualities, and circumstances, of the games here
    practised, but suppose them much the same in all points with those used
    at Rome, and other places, and with suitable grandeur and magnificence;
    whether in relation to hunting or fighting of wild beasts, of the same
    or different kinds, with one another, or with men; of the gladiators,
    wrestlings, of the pageants called by the ancients <em>pegmata</em>,
    whence our word seems derived; of the showers of saffron water to
    refresh the spectators; of the gods these places were dedicated to,
    and their festivals: the whole of these matters, by those that have
    a mind to make themselves acquainted therewith, is best learnt from
    authors who have largely and professedly handled the subject; such as
    the learned Lipsius before quoted, Donatus, and many more Pitiscus
    will inform us of in his Lexicon. It is not to be questioned, that the
    Romans, who had so firmly settled themselves here for the space of 400
    years, were for elegance and politeness much upon the level with those
    of the continent. But amongst other shows and diversions of beasts,
    we may safely imagine that our British bull-dogs bore a part, since
    the Romans brought them up for the use of the Italian amphitheatres.
    Claudian speaks of them thus,</p>

  <p class="noindent">But see a large and learned account of them from ancient authors in Mr.
    Camden’s <cite>Britannia</cite>, Hampshire, pag. 119.</p>

  <p>I shall give the reader a plain calculation of the number of people,
    that might commodiously be present at the solemn sports and diversions,
    made generally upon holy-days and great festivities of their gods.
    The people hereabouts told me, that once they executed a woman for
    petit-treason, in the middle of the <em>area</em>, by burning; which
    brought all the country round to the sight, and filled the whole place:
    they by a gross guess supposed there might be 10,000. But if we allow
    a foot and half for each person sitting, and the number of seats, as
    I have delineated it, 24; then one side of the building spread <em>in
    plano</em> will form a conic <em>frustrum</em> 440 feet long at top, 280
    at bottom; taking the medium number 360, multiplying it by 24, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
    gives us 8640 feet; from which take off a fourth part, to reduce it to
    single places of a foot and half, there remain 6480 places on one half
    of the amphitheatre; double this for the other side, and you produce
    12,960 single places for spectators upon the whole range of seats. For
    fear of exceeding the truth, I omit all that might occasionally stand
    on the terrace at top, the ascent up to it, and on the entrance.</p>

  <p>It would be vain to talk of the exact time, or the persons concerned
    in building this amphitheatre: but my friend Mr. Pownall of Lincoln,
    before spoken of, has a silver coin of Philippus, ploughed up in the
    very place. <i lang="la">imp. m. jul. philippus aug. ℞ lætit. fundat.</i>
    a Genius with a garland in his right, the helm of a ship in his left
    hand: the legend of the reverse, I must own, seems strongly to intimate
    he made or repaired this work, or that some solemn sports were here
    performed in his time; notwithstanding his melancholy and cynical
    nature, which Sext. Aurelius gives us an account of, or that he was
    a christian. He reigned about A. D. 240. yet I chuse to think it is
    of a higher date. Tacitus tells us, so early as the time of Agricola
    in Titus his reign, they began to introduce luxury among the Britons;
    for he exhorted them privately, and publicly assisted them, to build
    temples, places of public resort, and fine houses; and by degrees
    they came to those excitements to debauchery, portico’s, baths, and
    the like, of which we frequently find the ruins. Therefore we may
    suppose amphitheatres were not forgotton; and probably this was not
    later than that time, so near the southern coast, (which among the
    Britons themselves was the most civilised) so rich and fine a country:
    for Titus his father Vespasian, partly under Claudius the emperor,
    and partly under Aulus Plautius his lieutenant, conquered all the
    parts hereabouts (as we mentioned in the beginning of this letter)
    where he fought the Britons thirty times, subdued two of their most
    potent nations, took above twenty of their towns, and the whole Isle
    of Wight. No doubt but the people, inhabitants of this country, the
    <em>Durotriges</em>, and the town of Dorchester, <em>Durnovaria</em>, were
    included in his conquests; and they, whatever reign it was in, for
    their entertainment, erected this noble work; of which, in comparison
    of our modern bear-gardens, and places of prize-fighting, I shall
    venture to give it as my sentiment,</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE reasons I have to address the following journey to you, are
    both general and particular: of the first sort, the title affixed
    to it could not but put me in mind of your claim to these kind of
    disquisitions from any hand, whose excellent commentary on Antoninus’s
    Itinerary has deservedly given you the palm of ancient learning, and
    rendered your character classic among the chief restorers of the Roman
    Britain. But I am apprehensive it will be easier to make these papers
    of mine acceptable to the world, than to yourself, both as the most
    valuable part of them is your own, and as I purpose by it to remind
    you of favouring the public with a new edition of that work, to which
    I know you have made great additions; and in this I am sure they will
    join with me. The honour you have indulged me of a long friendship,
    the pleasure and advantage I have reaped in travelling with you, and
    especially a great part of this journey, are particular reasons, or
    rather a debt from myself and the world, if any thing of antique
    inquiries I can produce that are not illaudable, if what time I spend
    in travelling, may not be wholly a hunting after fresh air with the
    vulgar citizens, but an examination into the works of nature, and of
    past ages. I have no fears, that aught here will be less acceptable to
    you, because perhaps in some things I may differ from your sentiments:
    the sweetness of your disposition, and your great judgement, I know,
    will discern and applaud what is really just, and excuse the errors:
    difference of opinions, though false, is often of great service in
    furthering a discovery of the truth: to think for one’s self is the
    prerogative of learning; and no one, but a tyrant in books, will
    persecute another for it. It is certain, Antoninus his Itinerary is an
    endless fund of inquiry. I doubt not but in future researches I shall
    be induced as much to vary from myself as now from others; and, after
    our best endeavours, succeeding writers will correct us all.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Via Trinovantica.</span></div>

  <p>The last summer I travelled this whole Seventh Journey, and in the
    order of the Itinerary; but I took in several other places by the way,
    which relate to the clearing some parts of other journeys. Parallel to
    the great Icening-street, runs another Roman road from south-west to
    north-east,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> through London, beginning at the sea-coast in Hampshire by
    Rumsey, and ending at the sea-coast in Suffolk about Aldborough. The
    name of it is utterly lost: if I might have the liberty of assigning
    one, it should be <em>via Trinovantica</em>, as it tends to the country
    of those people; and names are necessary to avoid confusion. The lower
    part of it, or that comprehended between London and Ringwood upon the
    edge of Dorsetshire, is the subject of this journey; but because I have
    already given an account of several towns that relate to the XIIIth
    and XIVth journeys of Antoninus, which have some connexion with this,
    and that I conceive they are considerably faulty in the original, I
    shall run through some few more I had opportunity to see, and offer my
    conjectures towards the restitution of those journeys.</p>

  <p>Upon the great moor between Bagshot and Okingham, near East-Hamsted
    park, we saw a large camp upon a hill doubly ditched, commonly called
    Cæsar’s camp, as many more without any reason: there has been a well
    in it, and both Roman and British coins have been found there, one of
    Cunobelin in silver: its figure is not regular, but conformable to the
    top of the hill: near it are two large barrows, Ambury and Edgebury.
    At Berkham by Okingham I bought a very elegant British coin of gold,
    dug up by a woman in her garden: it is of the most ancient kind, and
    without letters. I saw a British gold coin found near Old Windsor;
    another dug up, 1719, at Hanmer hill, between Guildford and Farnham.</p>

  <p>All the country hereabouts, and to Silchester, is clay, moor, sand,
    gravel by spots, much boggy, springy land, much good land, but more
    bad: the water is blackish every where. Silchester is a place that
    a lover of antiquity will visit with great delight: it stands upon
    the highest ground thereabouts, but hid with wood, which grows very
    plentifully all about it. Many were the Roman roads that met here,
    though now scarce any road; which is the reason it is so little known:
    it is likewise inconvenient for travellers, because no inns are near
    it; and it may be serviceable to tell the curious, that Aldermaston is
    the nearest town where lodging is to be found, three miles off; for at
    the place we may truly say,</p>

  <p class="noindent">The walls of this city are standing, more or less perfect, quite
    round; perhaps the most intire of any in the Roman empire, especially
    the whole north side of the wall, which is a most agreeable sight.
    The composition is chiefly flint for the space of four foot high,
    then a binding of three layers of rag-stone laid flat: in many places
    five of these double intervals remain for a great length. There was
    a broad ditch quite round, and now for the most part impassable, and
    full of springs. Here and there Roman bricks are left in the walls.
    Though on the out-side they are of this considerable height, yet the
    ground within is so raised as nearly to be equal to the top, and that
    quite round crowned with oaks and other timber-trees of no mean bulk,
    and which Mr. Camden takes notice of in his time. Not long since,
    lady Blessington cut 500l. worth of timber from thence. Gildas says,
    Constantius the son of Constantine the Great built it, and sowed corn
    in the track of the walls, as an omen of their perpetuity:<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> indeed,
    now the whole city is arable; and among the fields Roman bricks, bits
    of pots, rubbish of buildings, are scattered every where, and coins
    are picked up every day. It is a parallelogram whose shortest side
    to the longest is as 3 to 4; its length about 2600 feet, its breadth
    2000; standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> conformable to the four cardinal points: it had two
    gates upon its length opposite. There is only one farm-house within
    it, and the church. To the east, by that house, the foundation of
    the gate is visible, and several Roman bricks thereabouts. All the
    yards here are like a solid rock, with rubbish, pavements and mortar,
    cemented together. The late Rev. Mr. Betham, minister of this place,
    a learned, curious and worthy person, had collected a vast number of
    coins and antiquities found here: he is buried under the north wall
    of the chancel without side: within is another monument of a person
    of quality: it is remarkable that a wall only divides them in their
    graves, who both met a sad and disastrous fate at different times
    in the same place, being drowned in Fleet-ditch. Onion-hole, in the
    middle of the southern wall, is a place much talked of here by the
    ignorant country people, which is only an arch in the foundation for
    the issue of a sewer: they have a like story here of this city being
    taken by sparrows. I saw a silver coin of Philippus, and a brass one
    of Constantine, and many more. A spring arises from under the wall at
    the church-yard. The streets are still visible in the corn. Rings with
    stones in them are often found, among inscriptions and all sorts of
    other antiquities.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Amphitheatre.</div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XLIII. 2d Vol.</div>

  <p>Five hundred foot without the city, on the north-east corner I espied
    another great curiosity, which the people think was a castle: I
    presently discerned it to be an amphitheatre: it is in bulk, in shape,
    and all points, the same as that at Dorchester, but not built of so
    solid materials; for it is chiefly clay and gravel: it stands in a
    yard by the road side, near a ruinous house and barn, upon a sloping
    piece of ground: eastward toward the road there is a pit: there it is
    sixty foot high on the out-side. The whole <em>area</em> or <em>arena</em>
    within is now covered with water, but they say it is not much above
    three foot deep: the bottom of it, and the work, must certainly be
    exceeding solid, and well compared, to retain the water so many years
    without draining through: it is a most noble and beautiful concave, but
    intirely over-grown with thorn-bushes, briars, holly, broom, furze,
    oak and ash trees, &amp;c. and has from times immemorial been a yard for
    cattle, and a watering-pond; so that it is a wonder their trampling has
    not defaced it much more. I examined this fine antiquity with all the
    exactness possible: the terrace at top, the circular walk, the whole
    form, is not obscure: it is posited exactly as that before described,
    with its longest diameter from north-east to south-west; its entrance
    north-east, though farthest from the city. There is an ascent to it
    from the entrance side, that being upon the lowest ground: at the upper
    end, the level of the ground is not much below the top of the terrace,
    and vastly above that of the <em>arena</em>; so that I conceive the
    better sort of the people went that way directly from the city into
    their seats: there is such a gap too in that part, from the ruin of
    the cave where the wild beasts were kept. An old house standing there
    with an orchard has forwarded its ruin from that quarter; and they
    have levelled some part of the terrace for their garden. Surveying the
    whole could not but put me in mind of that piece of Roman magnificence,
    when the emperors caused great trees to be taken up by the roots, and
    planted in the amphitheatres and circs, <em>pro tempore</em>, to imitate
    forests wherein they hunted beasts; which here is presented in pure nature.</p>

  <p>Riding along the road on the north side of Silchester, I left it with
    this reflection: Now a person of a moderate fortune may buy a whole
    Roman city, which once half a kingdom could not do; and a gentleman may
    be lord of the soil where formerly princes and emperors commanded. To
    the west of the place, but at some distance, runs a high bank overgrown
    with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> trees seemingly north and south: they say there is another
    such, south of the city: which would make one suspect they were raised
    by some besiegers. Farther on I crossed a great Roman road coming
    from Winchester: they call it Long-bank and Grimesdike. I have very
    often found this name applied to a road, a wall, a ditch of antiquity;
    which would make one fancy it is a Saxon word signifying the witches
    work; for the vulgar generally think these extraordinary works made by
    help of the devil. They told me it goes through Burfield and Reading.
    Towards Winchester I could see it as far as the horizon, perfectly
    strait, ten miles off. We may say with the poet,</p>

  <p class="noindent">Near it they talk of a stone thrown by an imp from Silchester walls, a
    mile off, which I suppose a mile-stone. Mr. Camden says a Roman road
    runs westward from Silchester, which I imagine goes to Andover. From
    Aldermaston is a fine view of the country hanging over the Kennet,
    lately made navigable. Going from Aldermaston to Kingsclere, where
    once was a palace of the Saxon kings, I passed over Brimpton common:
    here are many very fine Celtic barrows:<span class="sidenote"><em>Barrows</em> Br.</span> the soil is a moor full of
    <em>erica</em>, which they dig up for fewel; underneath it is sand: at
    Kingsclere the mighty chalk-hills begin. Upon the top of a very high
    promontory is a square Roman camp, in a park. From hence to Andover is
    an hard way and open country. Just before I descended the continuation
    of this great ridge of hills overlooking Andover, I crossed a ditch
    like Wansditch, hanging upon the edge of the hills, which I suppose
    some division among the ancient Britons: it extended itself both ways
    as far as I could see: the foss is not very large, though the bank is:
    the foss is northward.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Andaoreon.</div>

  <p>Andover is (not to be questioned) the <em>Andaoreon</em> of Ravennas:
    the name signifies the watery habitation; <em>annedh</em>, habitatio;
    <em>dur</em>, aqua. It stands on the slope of a hill just by the springs
    of the river Tees, or <em>t’isca</em>: they arise here northward of the
    town very plentiful, and are carried in a thousand rills through all
    the meadows, till they unite and pass under the bridge. The church is
    an aukward old building; the west door, of an ancient circular make.
    They are now pulling down the timber market-house to build a new one
    of stone: the market-place is a broad street. Upon a very high hill
    to the south-west is a large Roman camp, seeming to be admirably well
    fortified: it is called <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Bury-hill</span> Ro. <i>Camp</i>.</span>Bury hill. Between this and Stockbridge is
    Dunbury hill, a circular camp, doubly intrenched with various works at
    the entrance.</p>

  <p>I travelled along a fine downy country, ’till passing the river Bourn
    in Wiltshire I came to the Icening-street near Haradon hill; where I
    intended to observe the great eclipse of the sun, which was to be on
    the next day; of which memorable <em>phænomenon</em> I judge it will not
    be disagreeable if I repeat what I wrote of it.</p>

  <h3>To Dr. <i>Edmund Halley</i>.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">ACCORDING to my promise, I send you what I observed of the solar
    eclipse, though I fear it will not be of any great use to you. I was
    not prepared with any instruments for measuring time, or the like,
    and proposed to myself only to watch all the appearances that Nature
    would present to the naked eye on so remarkable an occasion, and which
    generally are overlooked, or but grosly regarded. I chose for my
    station a place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> called Haradon hill, two miles eastward from Amsbury,
    and full east from the opening of Stonehenge avenue, to which it is as
    the point of view. Before me lay the vast plain where that celebrated
    work stands, and I knew that the eclipse would appear directly over
    it: beside, I had the advantage of a very extensive prospect every
    way, this being the highest hill hereabouts, and nearest the middle of
    the shadow. Full west of me, and beyond Stonehenge, is a pretty copped
    hill, like the top of a cone lifting itself above the horizon: this is
    Clay hill, near Warminster, twenty miles distant, and near the central
    line of darkness, which must come from thence; so that I could have
    notice enough before-hand of its approach. Abraham Sturgis and Stephen
    Ewens, both of this place and sensible men, were with me. Though it was
    very cloudy, yet now and then we had gleams of sun-shine, rather more
    than I could perceive at any other place around us. These two persons
    looking through smoaked glasses, while I was taking some bearings
    of the country with a circumferentor, both confidently affirmed the
    eclipse was begun; when by my watch I found it just half an hour after
    five: and accordingly from thence the progress of it was visible,
    and very often to the naked eye; the thin clouds doing the office of
    glasses. From the time of the sun’s body being half covered, there was
    a very conspicuous circular <em>iris</em> round the sun, with perfect
    colours. On all sides we beheld the shepherds hurrying their flocks
    into fold, the darkness coming on; for they expected nothing less than
    a total eclipse, for an hour and a quarter.</p>

  <p>When the sun looked very sharp, like a new moon, the sky was pretty
    clear in that spot: but soon after a thicker cloud covered it; at which
    time the <em>iris</em> vanished, the copped hill before mentioned grew
    very dark, together with the horizon on both sides, that is, to the
    north and south, and looked blue; just as it appears in the east at
    the declension of day: we had scarce time to tell ten, when Salisbury
    steeple, six mile off southward, became very black; the copped hill
    quite lost, and a most gloomy night with full career came upon us. At
    this instant we lost sight of the sun, whose place among the clouds
    was hitherto sufficiently distinguishable, but now not the least trace
    of it to be found, no more than if really absent: then I saw by my
    watch, though with difficulty, and only by help of some light from
    the northern quarter, that it was six hours thirty-five minutes: just
    before this the whole compass of the heavens and earth looked of a
    lurid complexion, properly speaking, for it was black and blue; only
    on the earth upon the horizon the blue prevailed. There was likewise
    in the heavens among the clouds much green interspersed; so that the
    whole appearance was really very dreadful, and as symptoms of sickening
    nature.</p>

  <p>Now I perceived us involved in total darkness, and palpable, as I may
    aptly call it: though it came quick, yet I was so intent that I could
    perceive its steps, and feel it as it were drop upon us, and fall on
    the right shoulder (we looking westward) like a great dark mantle, or
    coverlet of a bed, thrown over us, or like the drawing of a curtain on
    that side: and the horses we held in our hands were very sensible of
    it, and crouded close to us, startling with great surprise. As much
    as I could see of the men’s faces that stood by me, had a horrible
    aspect. At this instant I looked around me, not without exclamations of
    admiration, and could discern colours in the heavens; but the earth had
    lost its blue, and was wholly black. For some time, among the clouds,
    there were visible streaks of rays, tending to the place of the sun as
    their centre; but immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> after, the whole appearance of the
    earth and sky was intirely black. Of all things I ever saw in my life,
    or can by imagination fancy, it was a sight the most tremendous.</p>

    <figcaption><i>The appearance of the</i> Total Solar eclipse <i>from
      Haradon hill May 11, 1724.</i></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Toward the north-west, whence the eclipse came, I could not in the
    least find any distinction in the horizon between heaven and earth, for
    a good breadth, of about sixty degrees or more; nor the town of Amsbury
    underneath us, nor scarce the ground we trod on. I turned myself round
    several times during this total darkness, and remarked at a good
    distance from the west on both sides, that is, to the north and south,
    the horizon very perfect; the earth being black, the lower part of
    the heavens light: for the darkness above hung over us like a canopy,
    almost reaching the horizon in those parts, or as if made with skirts
    of a lighter colour; so that the upper edges of all the hills were as a
    black line, and I knew them very distinctly by their shape or profile:
    and northward I saw perfectly, that the interval of light and darkness
    in the horizon was between Martinsal hill and St. Ann’s hill; but
    southward it was more indefinite. I do not mean that the verge of the
    shadow passed between those hills, which were but twelve miles distant
    from us: but so far I could distinguish the horizon; beyond it, not
    at all. The reason of it is this: the elevation of ground I was upon
    gave me an opportunity of seeing the light of the heavens beyond the
    shadow: nevertheless this verge of light looked of a dead, yellowish
    and greenish colour: it was broader to the north than south, but the
    southern was of a tawny colour. At this time, behind us or eastward
    toward London, it was dark too, where otherwise I could see the hills
    beyond Andover; for the foremost end of the shadow was past thither: so
    that the whole horizon was now divided into four parts of unequal bulk
    and degrees of light and dark: the part to the north-west, broadest
    and blackest; to the south-west, lightest and longest. All the change
    I could perceive during the totality, was that the horizon by degrees
    drew into two parts, light and dark; the northern hemisphere growing
    still longer, lighter, and broader, and the two opposite dark parts
    uniting into one, and swallowing up the southern enlightened part.</p>

  <p>As at the beginning the shade came feelingly upon our right shoulders,
    so now the light from the north, where it opened as it were: though
    I could discern no defined light or shade upon the earth that way,
    which I earnestly watched for; yet it was manifestly by degrees, and
    with oscillations, going back a little, and quickly advancing further;
    till at length upon the first lucid point appearing in the heavens,
    where the sun was, I could distinguish pretty plainly a rim of light
    running along-side of us a good while together, or sweeping by at our
    elbows from west to east. Just then, having good reason to suppose the
    totality ended with us, I looked on my watch, and found it to be full
    three minutes and a half more: now the hill-tops changed their black
    into blue again, and I could distinguish a horizon where the centre
    of darkness was before: the men cried out, they saw the copped hill
    again, which they had eagerly looked for: but still it continued dark
    to the south-east; yet I cannot say that ever the horizon that way was
    undistinguishable: immediately we heard the larks chirping and singing
    very briskly for joy of the restored luminary, after all things had
    been hushed into a most profound and universal silence: the heavens and
    earth now appeared exactly like morning before sun-rise, of a greyish
    cast, but rather more blue interspersed; and the earth, as far as the
    verge of the hill reached, was of a dark green or russet colour.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

  <p>As soon as the sun emerged, the clouds grew thicker, and the light was
    very little amended for a minute or more, like a cloudy morning slowly
    advancing. After about the middle of the totality, and so after the
    emersion of the sun, we saw Venus very plainly, but no other star.
    Salisbury steeple now appeared. The clouds never removed, so that we
    could take no account of it afterward, but in the evening it lightened
    very much. I hasted home to write this letter; and the impression was
    so vivid upon my mind, that I am sure I could, for some days after,
    have wrote the same account of it, and very precisely. After supper I
    made a drawing of it from my imagination, upon the same paper I had
    taken a prospect of the country before.</p>

  <p>I must confess to you, that I was (I believe) the only person in
    England that regretted not the cloudiness of the day, which added so
    much to the solemnity of the sight, and which imcomparably exceeded,
    in my apprehension, that of 1715, which I saw very perfectly from the
    top of Boston steeple in Lincolnshire, where the air was very clear:
    but the night of this was more complete and dreadful. There indeed
    I saw both sides of the shadow come from a great distance, and pass
    beyond us to a great distance; but this eclipse had much more of
    variety and majestic terror: so that I cannot but felicitate myself
    upon the opportunity of seeing these two rare accidents of nature, in
    so different a manner: yet I should willingly have lost this pleasure
    for your more valuable advantage of perfecting the noble theory of
    the celestial bodies, which last time you gave the world so nice a
    calculation of; and wish the sky had now as much favoured us for an
    addition to your honour and great skill, which I doubt not to be as
    exact in this as before.<span class="fright0"><i>Ambsbury, Wilts, May 10, 1724.</i></span></p>

  <p class="mt3">Return we to matters of antiquity. Upon this very hill-top are great
    pits dug lately by order of my lord Charlton for clay, which they find
    here of a very stiff sort, by nature let in like veins among clefts of
    the solid chalk: the workmen here, whilst they have been busy in taking
    it up, have found many Romans coins, silver and brass, some very deep
    in the earth, as they say; several of which I have now by me. I saw
    likewise a very fair gold <em>Constantius</em>; the reverse, two Genii
    holding a shield, <em>vot.</em> xxx. <cite>victoria Augg.</cite> It seems as if
    the Romans, with their wonted sagacity, had been occupied here in the
    same way, to make pottery ware, and not neglected to leave proof of it
    according to their method. I took notice likewise of one side of the
    summit being covered with oyster-shells loose upon the surface; and how
    they came there I could get no information.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Icening-street.</span></div>

  <p>The Icening-street runs between this hill and the Bourn river, coming
    from Newberry, as I suppose, through Chute forest, where vulgarly
    called Chute causeway: at Lurgishal it makes a fine terrace-walk in
    the garden of Sir Philip Medows; then passes the Bourn river about
    Tudworth, and so by this place to the eastern gate of Old Sarum, the
    Roman <span class="sidenote smcap">Sorbiodunum.</span><em>Sorbiodunum</em>, where it runs most precisely north-east
    and south-west, as we said before. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXV.</span>This city is perfectly round, and
    formed upon one of the most elegant designs one can imagine: probably
    a fortress of the old Britons, and I fancy somewhat like the famous
    Alesia in Gaul, memorable for the ancient Hercules, its founder, and
    for the siege of the great Cæsar; which only his genius could have
    taken in his circumstances. The prospect of this place is at present
    very august, and would have afforded us a most noble sight when in
    perfection: such a one will not be difficult to conceive when we have
    described it. It fills up the summit of a high and steep hill, which
    originally rose equally on all sides to an <em>apex</em>: the whole work
    is 1600 foot diameter, included in a ditch of a prodigious depth:
    it is so contrived that in effect it has two ramparts, the inner and
    outer, the ditch between: upon the inner, which is much the higher,
    stood a strong wall of twelve foot thick, their usual standard, which
    afforded a parapet at top for the defendants, with battlements quite
    round: upon still higher ground is another deep circular ditch, of 500
    foot diameter; this is the castle or citadel. Upon the inner rampire of
    this was likewise another wall, I suppose of like thickness: so that
    between the inner ditch and the outer wall, all around, was the city.
    This is divided into equal parts by a meridian line: both the banks are
    still left; one to the south, the other to the north; and these had
    walls upon them too: the traces of all the walls are still manifest,
    and some parts of them left; but we may say with the poet of the whole,</p>

  <p class="noindent">In the middle of each half, toward the east and west, is a gate,
    with each a lunette before it, deeply ditched, and two oblique
    entries; that to the east is square, to the west round: the hollow
    where the wall stood is visible quite round, though the materials
    are well-nigh carried away to New Sarum: in every quarter were two
    towers, the foundations plainly appearing: then, with those that
    were upon the cardinal points, the gates and the median rampart, as
    it must necessarily be understood, there were twelve in the whole
    circumference; so that, supposing it about 5000 feet in circumference,
    there was a tower at every 400. Hence we may imagine the nature of
    the city was thus: a circular street went round in the middle between
    the inner and outer fortifications, concentric to the whole work; and
    that cross streets, like <em>radii</em>, fronted each tower: then there
    were twenty-four islets of building for houses, temples, or the like.
    Now such is the design of this place, that if one half was taken by
    an enemy, the other would still be defensible; and at last they might
    retire into the castle. The city is now ploughed over, and not one
    house left. In the angle to the north-west stood the cathedral and
    episcopal palace: the foundations are at present so conspicuous, that I
    could easily mark out the ground-plot of it, as in the <a href="#i_182">65th plate</a>: near
    it is a large piece of the wall left, made of hewn stone with holes
    quite through at equal spaces. One would imagine the Romans, in laying
    down the <em>area</em> of this city, had Plato’s rules in view,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> in
    his fifth dialogue of laws. Many wells have been filled up, and, no
    doubt, with noble reliques of antiquity: they must have been very deep,
    and especially that in the castle, and dug out of the solid chalk.
    Of the castle-wall a good deal of huge fragments and foundations are
    left: a double winding stair-case led up to the gate, where bits of
    arch-work and immense strength of stone and mortar remains; and within,
    many foundations and traces of buildings. In the north-east corner of
    the city there is another rampart upon a <em>radius</em>, including a
    squarish piece of ground; probably for some public edifice, but what
    in particular, is now hard to say. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXVI.</span>Certainly, for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>strength, air, and
    prospect over the lovely downs, and for salubrity, this place was well
    calculated, and impregnable to any thing but death and hunger. The
    river Avon runs near the bottom of the hill. The history of its glory,
    its strange vicissitudes, and its ruin by removal of the church to
    New Sarum, may be learnt from Camden, Burton, and other authors; my
    business being chiefly to describe things: but the very sight of such a
    carcass would naturally from a traveller extort such an expostulation:
    Is this the ancient episcopal see, and the seat of warlike men, now
    become corn-fields, and pasture for sheep? Is this the place where
    synods have been held, and British parliaments; where all the states of
    the kingdom were summoned to swear fealty to William the Conqueror; the
    palace of the most potent British and Saxon kings, and Roman emperors?
    and conclude with Rutilius,</p>

  <p class="noindent">Before the eastern gate of <em>Sorbiodunum</em>, a branch of the <span class="sidenote">Roman <em>way</em>.</span>Roman
    way proceeds eastward to Winchester, which has never yet been observed:
    upon this goes part of the XVth imperial journey in these words;
    <em>Venta Belgarum, Brige, Sorbiodunum</em>. This way passes the river
    Bourn at Ford: the ridge of it is plain, though the countrymen have
    attacked it vigorously on both sides with their ploughs: we caught
    them at the sacrilegious work, and reprehended them for it: then it
    goes between Clarendon park, and the camp of Chlorus before described:
    on the whole length of Farley common it is very conspicuous, made of
    hard matter dug up all along on both sides; then ascends the hills
    at Winterslow, which signifies the white hill; then through Buckholt
    forest, where with good heed the course of it may be followed, though
    through by-ways, pastures, woods and hedges; sometimes running the
    length, sometimes crossing it: a little northward of West Titherley it
    goes close by a farm-house and large barn upon a rising ground, and at
    the edge of a wood. This is the proper distance of eight miles from
    <em>Sorbiodunum</em>, and was the ancient <span class="sidenote smcap">Brige.</span>Brige; and Roman antiquities
    are often found here: the British name imports a town upon the top of

  <p class="noindent">All this country being part of the Conqueror’s new forest, this colony

    wood from its being upon a hill, overlooking Broughton upon the river
    Wallop, where Mr. Camden places the Brige. A little way farther upon
    the same brink, on an <em>apex</em> of the hill, stands a large Celtic
    barrow, ditched about, called Bols turret:<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> there are several
    other barrows thereabouts, and probably some Roman; for the Roman
    road, here called the Cause-way, proceeds upon this edge to the river
    at Bossington, though sometimes intercepted by corn-fields, where the
    common road goes about, and then falls into it again: it passes over
    the river at Bossington, then marches directly to Winchester west gate.</p>

  <p>Having described this road, let us return to <em>Sorbiodunum</em>,
    in order to pursue the Icening-street: but first give me leave to
    impart to the reader somewhat of the pleasure you and I reaped at the
    neighbouring <span class="sidenote smcap">Wilton.</span>Wilton. I shall only at this time give a catalogue of my
    lord Pembroke’s most noble collection of ancient marbles, which may
    be of use to the curious, in knowing the particulars of that glorious
    <em>Musœum</em>, or that have a mind to view them.</p>

  <p>The BUSTO’S are in number 133.&nbsp; The STATUES 36.&nbsp; The BASSO RELIEVO’S 15.&nbsp; MISCELLANIES 9.</p>

  <p>III. BASSO RELIEVO’S. The Story of Niobe, <i lang="la">alto relievo</i>, very
    ancient: there are twenty figures; the marble is 2400 weight; seems to
    have been a pannel in some temple of Apollo, or Diana. The story of
    Meleager, being the side of a <em>sarcophagus</em>, seventeen figures,
    <i lang="la">mezzo relievo</i>, 1500 weight, of an admirable taste. Curtius on
    horseback, leaping into the gaping cavern, of most excellent work. M.
    Aurelius and Faustina, <i lang="la">adversa capita</i>, fine work. Caracalla,
    a three-quarters <i lang="la">relievo</i>. The three Graces. One on horseback,
    cutting at a soldier defending himself under the horse. The ancient
    manner of eating, Jupiter served by Hebe: he is accumbent. A frize of
    a sea-triumph, small figures. Cleopatra with the asps in a covered
    vase, <i lang="la">alto relievo</i>. Part of a frize from a temple of Neptune,
    Naiades and Tritons. A <i lang="la">basso</i> from a temple of Bacchus, the
    <i lang="la">thyrsus</i>, &amp;c. A <i lang="la">basso relievo</i> on porphyry of Roemitalces
    king of Thrace. A child stealing fruit from the altar through a mask.</p>

  <p>IV. MISCELLANIES. A nuptial vase, representing the ceremonies of
    marriage. Ara Hammonis, a cube of white marble, on front the symbol
    of Jupiter Hammon on a circular piece of the old Theban marble. Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
    black porphyry pillars brought from Rome by the earl of Arundel. The
    column of Egyptian granite, weighing near 7000 weight, from the ruins
    of the temple of Venus genetrix, built by Julius Cæsar: this my lord
    has set up in the front of the house. A very ancient altar of Bacchus,
    adorned with <i lang="la">basso relievo’s</i>. An altar table of red Egyptian
    granite, large, and four or five inches thick. An antique pavement,
    four sorts of marble, of gradual light and shade. The antique picture
    from the temple of Juno: it is in thick stucco. The <em>sarcophagus</em>
    of Epaphroditus intire, finely carved with the history of Ceres. The
    front of Claudia’s sepulchre, sister of Probus the emperor: her head is
    joined with his. Eighty-five <em>termini</em> of antique marbles, busto’s
    on seventy-two of them.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Icening-street.</span></div>

  <p>From the gate of <em>Sorbiodunum</em> the Icening-street goes from
    north-east to south-west, by the name of Port lane, over the river Avon
    at Stretford; then ascends the hill, and passes the united Nadre and
    Willy near Bemerton, where the stony ford is still very perfect: then
    it goes across my lord Pembroke’s horse-race course and hare-warren,
    making a visto to M. Aurelius his equestrian figure in the park. If
    the spirits and <em>genii</em> of the ancient Romans travel this way, no
    doubt they will be surprised to find themselves so near the Capitol.
    Then it traverses the brook at Fenny-Stretford, and so along the great
    downs toward Cranburn chace: here it delights one to turn and survey
    its direction towards <em>Sorbiodunum</em>, a sweet prospect; whether we
    regard what share of it is due to nature, or what to art; and of the
    latter sort, what is owing to the road, or what to the old city. As
    it enters the chace there is a most remarkable <em>diverticulum</em>,
    and which notoriously demonstrates it was begun from the south: for
    here, as it came from thence across the woods, where its ridge is very
    perfect, made of stone, it butts full upon the end of a vast valley,
    very deep and of steep descent; where it was absolutely impracticable
    to carry the road on in a strait line: the Roman surveyor therefore
    wisely gave way to nature, turned the road side-ways along the end of
    the valley, then with an equal angle carried it forward upon the upper
    side of that valley in full direction to Old Sarum. That great and
    wise people, though ignorant of submission, knew nature might be drawn
    aside, but not directly opposed, especially in works that are to be
    lasting: hence my intent was, to pursue this noble road as far as it
    would carry me; and the pleasure one perceives in such a concomicant
    is not to be imagined by any one but those that experience it: to
    observe their methods in the conduct of such works, their artifices
    and struggles between industry and the difficulties and diversities of
    ground, of rivers, &amp;c. and the continual presentment of somewhat worthy
    of remark by the way, renders it short, and vastly entertaining; nor
    is the mind ever at a loss for learned amusement. When it has passed
    through the woods of Cranburn chace, and approaches Woodyates, you see
    a great dike and <em>vallum</em> (Venndike) upon the edges of the hills
    to the left by Pentridge, to which I suppose it gave name: this crosses
    the Roman road, and then passes on the other side, upon the division
    between the hundred. The large <em>vallum</em> here is southward, and it
    runs upon the northern brink of the hills; whence I conjecture it a
    division or fence thrown up by the <em>Belgæ</em> before Cæsar’s time.
    I call this the second boundary of the <em>Belgæ</em>; two others are
    already mentioned. I pleased myself with the hopes of observing the
    Roman road running over it, as doubtless it did originally: but just
    at that instant both enter a lane, where every thing is disfigured
    with the wearing away and reparations that have been made ever since.
    Its high ridge is then inclosed within a pasture just at Woodyates,
    then becomes the common road for half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> a mile, but immediately passes
    forward upon a down, the road going off to the right. I continued
    the Roman road for two or three mile, where it is rarely visited:
    it is very beautiful, smooth on both sides, broad at top, the holes
    remaining whence it was taken, with a ditch on each hand: it is made of
    gravel, flint, or such stuff as happened in the way, most convenient
    and lasting. There are vast numbers of Celtic barrows upon these
    downs, just of such manner and shapes as those of Salisbury plain:
    at the first and more considerable group I came to, there was a most
    convincing evidence of the Roman road being made since the barrows:
    two instances of this nature I gave in the last letter. One form of
    these barrows, for distinction sake, I call Druids (for what reasons I
    shall not stand here to dispute:) they are thus. A circle of about 100
    foot diameter, more or less, is inclosed with a ditch of a moderate
    breadth and depth: on the outside of this ditch is a proportionate
    <em>vallum</em>; in the centre of this inclosure is a small tump, where
    the remains of the person are buried, sometimes two, sometimes three.
    Now so it fell out, that the line of direction of the Roman road
    necessarily carried it over part of one of these <em>tumuli</em>, and
    some of the materials of the road are dug out of it: this has two
    little tumps in its centre.</p>

  <p>It was now my business to look out for the station in Antoninus called
    <em>Vindogladia</em>, mentioned in the last journey to be twelve mile
    from <em>Sorbiodunum</em>. By this time I was come to a proper distance:
    accordingly I found, at the end of this heath, the road which is all
    along called Iclingdike, descended a valley where a brook crosses it,
    from two villages called Gliffet. At All-Saints, or Lower Gliffet,
    there was a small ale-house, and the only one hereabouts (the Rose:)<span class="sidenote smcap">Vindogladia.</span>
    my old landlady, after some discourse preparatory, informed me that
    at Boroston, a mile lower upon the river, had been an old city; and
    that strangers had come out of their way on purpose to see it; that
    ruins and foundations were there; that it had seven parish-churches,
    which were beaten down in the war time; that many old coins had been
    ploughed up when she was a girl, which the children commonly played
    withal; but the case at present was plainly the same with that of old
    Troy, described in the ballad upon her wall, where she showed me these
    passionate verses,</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">Waste lie those walls that were so good,</div>
        <div class="i0">And corn now grows where Troy towers stood.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">This account, so natural, satisfied me that <em>Vindogladia</em> must
    here be fixed, and Wimbornminster be robbed of that honour, where the
    tide of antiquarians have hitherto carried it, for no other reason but
    name sake; the distances and road being repugnant. I suppose the name
    signifies the white river, or vale; <em>vint</em>, white; <em>gladh</em>,
    a river; whence our glade, or valley where a river runs. This place
    being not capable of affording me a proper mansion, I left the more
    particular scrutiny of it for another opportunity.</p>

  <p>Hence I pursued the road on the opposite chalk-hill, where they have
    dug it away to burn for lime, but much degenerate from Roman mortar in
    strength: it was not long before I absolutely lost it in great woods
    beyond Long Crechil; but by information I learnt that it passes the
    Stour at Crayford bridge below Blandford, where I was obliged to take
    up my nightly quarters. I was glad to gain the downy country again
    westward of it, and still full of barrows of all sorts by clusters or
    groups. I frequently observed on the sides of hills long divisions,
    very strait, crossing one another with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> kinds of angles: they
    look like the balks or meres of ploughed lands, and are really made
    of flint over-grown with turf: they are too small for ploughed lands,
    unless of the most ancient Britons, who dealt little that way; but just
    such like have I seen in what I always imagine British camps. Above the
    town of Blandford is an odd intrenchment on a hill, a squarish work,
    with others like the foundation of small towers: a barrow near it.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Blandford.</div>

  <p>Blandford is a pretty town, pleasantly seated in a flexure of
    the river, before charming meadows, and rich lands. Wood thrives
    exceedingly here: indeed this country is a fine variety of downs,
    woods, lawns, arable, pasture, and rich valleys; and an excellent air:
    the dry easterly winds, the cold northern, and the western moisture,
    are tempered by the warm southern saline breezes from the ocean, and
    nearest the sun. The incredible number of barrows that over-spread
    this country from the sea-side to North Wiltshire, persuade me a great
    people inhabited here before the <em>Belgæ</em>, that came from Spain,
    which we may call the <em>Albionites</em>: but it is not a time to
    discourse of that. This year, wherever I travelled, I found the bloom
    of the hedge-rows, and indeed all trees whatever, excessively luxuriant
    beyond any thing I ever knew. In this part the <em>buck-thorn</em>, or
    <i lang="la">rhamnus catharticus</i>, is very plentiful; and a traveller, if he
    pleases, may swallow a dozen of the ripe berries, not without use. Near
    the passage of the Icening-street at Crayford is Badbury, a vast Roman
    camp, where antiquities have been found.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Wansdike.</div>

  <p>About three mile beyond this I found another ditch and rampart, which
    I believe to be the first of the colony of the <em>Belgæ</em>; it has
    indeed a rude ancient look; so that they made four of these boundaries
    successively as their power enlarged, the last being Wansdike,
    between North and South Wiltshire. By what I could see or learn, in
    travelling over this intricate country, the Roman road passes upon a
    division between Pimpern and Bere hundred to Bere; and that I reckon
    a convenient distance for a station between <em>Vindogladia</em> and
    Dorchester, being near the middle: on one side it is about thirteen
    mile, on the other nine. Now in the last journey of Antoninus before
    mentioned, immediately after <span class="sidenote smcap">Ibernium.</span><em>Vindogladia</em> follows <em>Durnovaria
    M. P.</em> IX. Dorchester being very truly nine mile off this town Bere,
    and which is a market-town too, but far otherwise as to Wimbornminster;
    I doubt not but this is the true place designed in the Itinerary; but
    that a town is slipped out of the copies. I think I have fortunately
    discovered it in the famous Ravennas, by which we may have hopes of
    restoring this journey to its original purity. That author mentions a
    town next to <em>Bindogladia</em>, which he calls <em>Ibernium</em>: this
    verily is our Bere. Mr. Baxter corrects it into <em>Ibelnium</em>, and
    places it at Blandford, for no other reason, as I conceive, but because
    he imagined it must necessarily be hereabouts. I was not a little
    pleased when I found my notion highly confirmed by a great and elegant
    <span class="sidenote">Ro. <i>Camp</i>.</span>Roman camp upon a hill near Bere, I think it is called Woodbury, where
    a yearly fair is kept: <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLV 2d Vol.</span>this is between Bere and Milburn upon the
    river: it is doubly intrenched, or rather a double camp one within
    another. This town of Bere denominates the hundred too. In this case,
    where a Roman camp, a road, and all distances concur, which in the
    others are very abhorrent from reality, I imagine the reader will find
    little difficulty in passing over to my sentiments. The town is called
    <em>Bere Regis</em>, and the camp is the <em>Æstiva</em> to the town. Of
    Dorchester I have spoken already, beyond which is the original of the
    Icening-street: from thence I travelled along the southern coasts, in
    order to come to the beginning of this seventh journey.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Moriconium.</div>

  <p>Wareham is denominated from the passage or ford over the two rivers
    between which it is situate, where now are bridges: this has been a
    Roman town. A great square is taken in, with a very high <em>vallum</em>
    of earth, and a deep ditch: there has been a castle by the water-side,
    west of the bridge, built by William the Conqueror, perhaps upon the
    Roman. It is an old corporation, now decayed, the sands obstructing the
    passage of vessels; and Pool, being better seated, from a fisher’s town
    has rose to be a rich flourishing sea-port, robbing this place. They
    say here have been many parish-churches, and a mint. This is probably
    the <em>Moriconium</em> of Ravennas, as Mr. Baxter asserts. I heard of
    Roman coins being found here. This country is sandy for the most part,
    as commonly toward the sea-coasts. I saw a ruinous religious house as
    I came by the side of the river Frome. This haven is of a vast extent,
    like a sea, having a narrow entry; an indulgent formation of Nature to
    her beloved island of Great Britain. I saw vast stones lying loose upon
    this sand, in some places, like the Wiltshire grey weathers. It is a
    melancholy unpleasant view hereabouts for travellers, when they come
    from the other delightful scenes of the better parts of Dorsetshire:
    it is moory for the most part, full of ling or heath, as on all the
    sea-coasts here, from the chalk-hills in Dorsetshire to those in
    Sussex. Two rocks about Corf castle have an odd appearance hence.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Alauna.</div>

  <p>Wimburnminster is a small place, of no great trade: a large old church
    with two towers; the middle one in the cross very old, and most of the
    church before the time of the Conquest: this middle steeple had a spire
    which fell down. The river Stour runs a little way south of the town,
    through a large bridge; <em>sdour</em>, a <em>sibilus</em> put to the old
    Celtic word. The river Alen in several divisions runs through the town,
    which makes me think it to be the <em>Alauna</em> of Ravennas, put next
    to <span class="sidenote smcap">Bolnelaunium.</span><i>Bolnelaunium</i>, which I conjecture to be Christ’s-church by the
    sea-side, that being subsequent to <em>Moriconium</em>: that it was not
    Pool, as Mr. Baxter places it, is plain from a reason just mentioned,
    Pool being an upstart. Wimburnminster stands in a large extended
    fruitful vale like a meadow, with much wood about it. These rivers
    abound with fish. Here was a nunnery built anno 712, by Cuthburga
    sister to king Ina. King Etheldred was buried here.</p>

  <p>From hence I went to Ringwood upon the river Avon, over a deep sandy
    moor; which has ever been thought the <span class="sidenote smcap">Regnum.</span><em>Regnum</em> in the Itinerary,
    and begins the <i lang="la">Iter septimum</i> of Antoninus.<span class="sidenote">TAB. XLVI. 2d Vol.</span> It is a large
    thriving place, full of good new brick houses, seated by the side of a
    great watery valley, the river dividing itself into several streams,
    and frequently overflowing large quantities of the meadow: it seems
    well calculated to have been an old British town: they deal pretty
    much in leather here, and woollen manufactures of stockings, druggets,
    narrow cloth. Roman discoveries I could make little; but the name and
    distances seem to establish the matter: so I hastened through New
    Forest, where I found it necessary to steer by the compass, as at sea.
    They tell us at Wattonsford the memory of Tyrrel is still preserved,
    as passing over there when he unawares shot William Rufus. The soil
    is sand, gravel, stone, clay by parcels: these are pleasant solitudes
    for a contemplative traveller, did not the intricacies of the roads
    give one uneasiness. Here are whole acres of the most beautiful
    <em>fox-gloves</em> that one can see, rising upon a strong stem, adorned
    with numerous bell-flowers as high as one’s horse. Mr. Baxter has a
    right notion of this name, signifying <i lang="la">lemurum manicæ</i>, from the
    supposed fairies. I take these names, and foxes bells, and the like,
    to be reliques of the Druids, who did great cures by them; for this
    is a plant of powerful qualities, when prudently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> administered,
    in a constitution that will bear it. I observe we derive the names of
    very many plants from the old Celtic language, as I believe the Greeks
    and Latins did likewise. The king’s house, as called still, was at
    Lyndhurst: the duke of Bolton has a hunting-seat thereabouts. I rode
    through an old camp in the midst of the forest: it is overgrown with
    wood, seems to have been round: at bottom is a spring: no doubt but it
    is a British <span class="sidenote">Br. <i>oppidum</i>.</span><em>oppidum</em>. You may see Southampton from thence. They
    say the king was killed hereabouts. Here is a great plantation of young
    oaks, for the use of the crown: a great deal of fine oak-timber left;
    but the beech-trees are very stately and numerous.</p>

  <p>Romsey was unquestionably a Roman town, and its present name shows as
    much. The church is a noble old pile of architecture, arched with stone
    in the form of a cross, with semi-circular chapels in the upper angles.
    These churches, hereabouts called minsters, were doubtless built by
    the Saxon kings as soon as they became christian: the manner of their
    structure is much like those built by queen Helena in Palestine: at
    the west end of it is a bit of an old wall, perhaps belonging to the
    nunnery built here by king Edgar. I heard of a silver Roman coin found
    here. This town is an old corporation, in situation extraordinary
    pleasant, having woods, corn-fields, meadows, pastures, around it in
    view: the river and rivulets, which are many, have a rapid course.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Venta Belgarum.</span></div>

  <p>Two miles before I came to Winchester, the downs of chalk begin
    again with barrows upon them. I saw several double ones. The walls
    of Winchester inclose a long square about 700 paces one way, 500 the
    other: it stands on the western declivity of a hill,<span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXIII.</span> the river running
    below on the east. Many branches, and cuts of it too, pass through the
    midst of the city, and render their gardens very pleasant: the walls
    and gates, as repaired in times long after the Roman, and chiefly of
    flint, are pretty intire; no doubt, built upon the old Roman. In the
    higher part of the city is the castle, which overlooks the whole:<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
    here is a famed round table, where king Arthur’s knights used to sit. I
    saw some great ruins still left of the walls and towers that belonged
    to it; but the main of it was pulled down when Sir Christopher Wren
    projected the king’s palace there in king Charles the IId’s reign:
    it fronts the west end of the cathedral. The houses in the town were
    bought in order to make a street between both, which would have had a
    noble effect. This palace is a large pile of building, and beautiful,
    yet with all the plainness that was necessary to save an extravagant
    expence, or that became a royal retirement: it fills up three sides
    of a large square, so that the opening of the wings or front looks
    over the city: three tier of windows, twenty-six in a row, fill up
    every side externally, besides the fronton in the middle of each side,
    composed of four Corinthian pilasters: a handsome balustrade runs
    quite round the top: the inside of this open court is more elegant,
    and enriched with portico’s, &amp;c. the late duke of Tuscany gave some
    fine marble pillars towards the adorning it. A great bridge was to
    have been built across the foss in the principal front; and a garden,
    park, &amp;c. were to have been made before the back front: the citizens
    entertain great hopes, that since the happy increase of the royal
    family, this palace will be finished: it is of plain brick-work, but
    the window-cases, fascias, cornice, &amp;c. of good Portland stone. There
    is a great old chapel near it. This place was the residence of the
    potent kings of the West Saxons.</p>

  <p>The cathedral is a venerable and large pile: the tower in the middle
    and transept are of ancienter work than the choir and the body. Inigo
    Jones <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>has erected a delicate screen of stone-work before the choir.
    Here was the burial-place of many Saxon and Norman kings, whose remains
    the impious soldiers in the civil wars threw against the painted glass:
    they show too the tomb of king Lucius. Queen Mary was here married to
    Philip of Spain: the chair used in that ceremony is still preserved.
    In the body of the church is a very ancient font, with odd sculptures
    round it. In the city is a pretty cross of Gothic workmanship, but ill
    repaired. Without the southern gate is a stately fabric, the college,
    erected and endowed by William of Wickham, bishop here, for education
    of youth. There is good painted glass of imagery in the chapel windows:
    in the middle of the cloysters is a strong stone building, the library,
    well contrived to prevent fire: the school is a more modern structure,
    handsome, with a very good statue of the founder over the door, made
    by Cibber. This country is intirely chalk, whence I suppose the name
    of <em>Venta</em>: the city is a genteel and pleasant place, and abounds
    with even the elegancies of life. Beyond the river eastward is a high
    hill, called St. Giles’s, from an hospital once there; now only some
    ruins of it to be seen, and a church-yard, seeming to have been a
    camp, beside the marks of bastions, and works of fortifications in the
    modern stile. Here Waltheof, earl of Northumberland and Huntingdon, was
    beheaded, by order of William I. whose body was carried to Crowland,
    and asserted to have miraculous virtues.</p>

  <p>In digging the foundation of a house near the college, in a stone
    coffin was found a stone set in a gold ring, with this inscription in
    very old characters, supposed about the sixth century.</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">A mile to the south of Winchester is a magnificent hospital, called
    Holy Cross, founded by bishop Blois: the church is in the form of a
    cross, and has a large square tower. Over it, on the other side the
    river, hangs a camp upon St. Catharine’s hill, with a <em>brachium</em>
    reaching down to the water side, for convenience of that element. The
    way between Winchester and Southampton we perceived plainly to be a
    Roman road, especially as far as the chalk reached: then we came to a
    forest where the soil is gravelly all the way.</p>

  <div class="sidenote smcap">Southampton.</div>

  <p>Southampton was strongly walled about with very large stones, full of
    those little white shells, like honey-combs, that grow upon the back
    of oysters: this is a sort of stone extremely hard, and seems to be
    gathered near the beach of the sea. These walls have many lunettes, and
    towers, in some places doubly ditched; but the sea encompasses near
    half the town: it was built in the time of king Edward III. I observe
    they have a method of breaking the force of the waves here, by laying a
    bank of sea-ore, as they call it: it is composed of long, slender, and
    strong filaments, like pilled hemp, very tough and durable; I suppose
    it is thrown up by the ocean: and this performs its work better than
    walls of stone, or natural cliff. At the south-east corner, near the
    quay, is a fort with some guns upon it, called the Tower: on one we saw
    this inscription,</p>

  <div class="center"><i>Henricus</i> VIII. <i>Anglie, Franciæ</i> &amp; <i>Hiberniæ rex,<br>
      fidei defensor invictissimus f. f.</i><br>
    MD. XXXXII. HR. VIII.</div>

  <p class="noindent">In the north-west corner was a strong castle with a mount, walled
    about at top, as a keep: upon this a round stone tower, with a
    winding ascent: the Anabaptists are about pulling it down, to build
    a meeting-house. The main of this town consists of one broad street,
    running through its length: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>there are many old religious ruins,
    and great warehouses, cellars, store-houses, &amp;c. but with their trade
    gone to decay. It was a great sea-port not long since, and had the
    sole privilege, by charter, of importing wine from France, till they
    foolishly sold it to the city of London.</p>

  <p>The old Roman city stood more eastward, upon the banks of the river
    Itching coming from Winchester, where now is a hamlet called St.
    Mary’s. There is a handsome new church<span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXIX.</span> built upon the ruins of an old
    one, which they say was burnt in some French wars: it is near the
    present ferry and opposite to Bittern. Many antiquities have been found
    upon the site of the old city. Likewise at Bittern was an old Roman
    castle, surrounded by a ditch, into which the sea-water flowed: many
    antiquities likewise have hence been produced, of which Mr. Camden
    gives us an account. Perhaps the buildings on both sides the river
    were comprehended under one name of <em>Trausantum</em>; therefore this
    river must have been the <em>Antona</em>: it was ruined in the Danish
    wars, and Southampton arose from its ashes. This is the place memorable
    for the famous experiment of king Canute, who sitting upon the banks
    of the river, crowned and in regal robes, commanded the tide not to
    approach his footstool; but the ocean, like an unlimited monarch, was
    as regardless of his menaces, as the Hellespont, of Xerxes his bridles
    and fetters.</p>

  <p>Leaving this lesson of the perishing glory of monarchs and cities too,
    we journeyed to Portsmouth, an entertaining sight of the maritime
    majesty of Great Britain, in this point excelling the ancient Roman
    grandeur. Over a moory common we passed by Fareham, and by Portchester,
    a castle made out of a Roman city. We have little reason to doubt that
    this is the <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Portus Magnus.</span></span><i lang="la">portus magnus</i> of Ptolemy, as it deserves to be
    called, where a thousand sail of the biggest ships may ride secure: the
    mouth of it is not so broad, as the Thames at Westminster, and that
    secured by numerous forts; on Gosport side, <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXX.</span>Charles fort, James fort,
    Borough fort, which name seems to intimate a Roman citadel formerly
    there; Blockhouse fort, which has a platform of above twenty great guns
    level with the water: and on the other side, by Portsmouth, Southsea
    castle, built by Henry VIII. of a like model with those I saw near Deal
    upon the Kentish shore.</p>

  <p>Portsmouth is the most regular fortification, of the modern manner,
    which we have in England;<span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXIX.</span> a curious sight to those that have not been
    out of it. The government has bought more ground lately for additional
    works, and no doubt it is capable of being made impregnable; for
    a shallow water may be brought quite round it. Here is one of the
    greatest arsenals for the royal navy: above thirty men of war of the
    highest rates lie here, capable of being fitted out in less than a
    fortnight; among them, the Royal William, that can play off at once 120
    battering-rams of brass, infinitely more forceable than that famous
    one Titus used against the walls of Jerusalem. The yards, the docks,
    the store-houses, where all their furniture is laid up in the exactest
    order, so that the men can go in the dark and fetch out any individual,
    is a sight beyond imagination. The immense quantities of cables,
    masts and tackle, of great guns, bullets, bombs, carcasses, mortars,
    granado’s, &amp;c. these of all sorts and sizes, and the regular methods
    they are reposited in and distinguished by, are prodigious, and no
    where to be equalled but in England; for when I was informed that this
    place is outdone, in all the particulars, both at Chatham and Plymouth,
    there was no more room left for wonder. The Royal William’s mast is a
    noble piece of timber 124 foot long, and this is only the bottom part
    of the main mast; it is 36 inches diameter, clear timber: its lantern
    is like a summer-house: its great anchor and all accoutrements are
    equally astonishing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> The rope-house is 870 foot long, one continued
    room, almost a quarter of a mile: we chanced to have the pleasure of
    seeing a great cable made here; it requires 100 men to work at it, and
    so hard the labour, that they can work but four hours in a day. The
    least complement of men continually employed in the yard is a thousand,
    and that but barely sufficient ordinarily to keep the naval affairs
    in good repair. But I have talked enough of matters so much out of my
    sphere. I was sorry to leave this amazing scene of naval grandeur, with
    the shocking sight of a wretched statue of king William, gilt indeed in
    an extraordinary manner; but of all the bad works in this fort, I have
    seen, it is the very last. From Portsmouth there is a fine prospect of
    the isle of Wight, famous for Vespasian’s first attempts in subduing
    the southern parts of Britain: its beautiful elevations, some woody,
    some downy, its towns, havens and white cliffs, at this distance, seem
    to persuade one it is an epitome of Great Britain, as that of the
    world; or that Nature made it as an essay, or copy, of her greater and
    more finished work. Before I leave Portsmouth I shall set down this
    catalogue of the British fleet as it stands this present year, given
    me by an officer; by which some people, fond of magnifying the mimic
    endeavours of some other powers, may calculate, if they please, when
    such will come up to rival it.</p>

  <p>I observed, the great quantity of water and ditches about this place
    is apt to render it aguish. The reader will excuse me from giving
    any description of the fortifications here, for the same reason that
    I did not offer to draw any thing; but passing by draw-bridges,
    bastions, gates, fosses, counterscarps, &amp;c. we repeated our steps to
    the Ports-down hills, which are of chalk, and at a reasonable distance
    from the shore extend themselves into Sussex; leaving to the south a
    less elevated, woody, and rich country. Here we turned to admire the
    delightful view of the ground we had passed, and that we were going to:
    the ports, creeks, bays, the ocean, the castles fixt, and those moving
    on the water, the isle of Wight in its full extent, all lay before us,
    and under the eye, as in a map: Portchester, Gosport, which is a very
    considerable town, Portsmouth, Southampton, Chichester, and all the
    sea-coast from Portland isle to the <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXII.</span>Sussex coasts, were taken in at one
    ken. I took a little sketch of it in passing, in <a href="#i_195_1">plate 82</a>.</p>

  <p>We found some of the Roman way upon this ridge, which I suppose went
    through Fareham and Havant, between <em>Trausantum</em> and Chichester,
    with a vicinal turning out to Portchester: it goes east and west.
    We passed by a large long barrow. We were led to Chichester by the
    fame of a most ancient inscription lately discovered there, whereof
    transcripts were handed about, that appeared not exact enough: this has
    revived the lustre of Chichester; for, though the termination of its
    name, and a Roman road called Stane-street coming to it, is evidence
    sufficient of its being a Roman city, yet none has positively affirmed
    it, because we have not hitherto been able to assign it a name. Mr.
    Camden satisfied himself that it owed its name and foundation to Cissa,
    the South-Saxon king. It is probable the city was destroyed soon after
    the Romans evacuated this kingdom, either in the wars between the
    Britons and first Saxons, or by the plundering Danes, who ravaged all
    the sea-coasts; so that its name was utterly forgot: but Cissa becoming
    master of this country, and there chusing to fix his seat, repaired
    the ancient castle or walls, whose <em>vestigia</em> were of too lasting
    materials wholly to have lost the appearance of their workmanship: then
    it was natural enough to prefix his name to this Roman termination, by
    which the Saxons always called castles of the Romans: or it might be
    simply called <em>caster</em>, <em>chester</em>, as was frequent in other
    places, till he restored it; and then it took his name, importing
    <em>Cissa’s chester</em>: but had it been originally founded by him, it
    would never have assumed that adjunct.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXI.</div>

  <p>I doubt not but the walls of the present city are built upon the
    old Roman foundations chiefly. It is of a roundish form, the river
    running under part of the walls. Two principal streets cross it at
    right angles upon the cardinal points, where stands a curious cross
    erected by bishop Read. The church takes up one of these quadrants: it
    is remarkable for two side-ailes on both sides, and the pictures of
    all the kings and queens of England since Cissa, which are hung upon
    the wall of the southern transept; all the bishops on the opposite
    wall. Eastward of the cathedral is a place called the <em>Pallant</em>,
    which seems derived from the Latin <em>palatium</em>. In the middle
    of North-street was dug up this memorable inscription, which I have
    printed in <a href="#i_148_1">plate 49</a>. To your explication of it nothing can be added:
    the reader and myself will be obliged to you for the leave you have
    given me here to insert it. It was happy we took great care in
    transcribing the letters; for, since it has been in the possession
    of the duke of Richmond, I hear a workman, who pretended to set the
    fragments together, has defaced it.</p>

  <h3><i>An Account of a</i> ROMAN INSCRIPTION <i>found at</i> Chichester.<br>
    <i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Roger Gale</span>, <i>Esq.</i></h3>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XLIX.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS inscription, as curious as any that has yet been discovered in
    Britain, was found, the beginning of last April, at Chichester, in
    digging a cellar under the corner house of St. Martin’s lane, on the
    north side, as it comes into North-street. It lay about four foot
    under ground, with the face upwards: by which it had the misfortune
    to receive a great deal of damage from the picks of the labourers, as
    they endeavoured to raise it; for, besides the defacing of several
    letters, what was here disinterred of the stone was broke into four
    pieces: the other part of it, still wanting, is, in all probability,
    buried under the next house, and will not be brought to light till
    that happens to be rebuilt. The inscription is cut upon a grey Sussex
    marble, the length of which was six Roman feet, as may be conjectured
    by measuring it from the middle of the word TEMPLVM to that end of it
    which is intire, and is not altogether three foot English, from the
    point mentioned: the breadth of it is 2 and ¾ of the same feet; the
    letters beautifully and exactly drawn; those in the two first lines
    three inches long, and the rest 2¼.</p>

  <p>Being at Chichester in September last with Dr. Stukeley, we took an
    accurate view of this marble, which is now fixed in the wall under
    a window within the house where it was found; and, that we might be
    as sure of the true reading as possible, wherever the letters were
    defaced, we impressed a paper with a wet sponge into them, and by that
    means found those in the fifth line to have been as we have expressed
    them above, and not as in other copies that have been handed about of
    this inscription.</p>

  <p>The only letter wanting in the first line is an N before EPTVNO, and
    so no difficulty in reading that. As to the second, though it was more
    usual, in inscriptions of this nature, to express the donation by the
    word SACRVM only, referring to the <em>temple</em>, or <em>altar</em>,
    dedicated; yet we have so many instances, in Gruter’s <cite>Corpus
    Inscriptionum</cite>, of TEMPLVM and ARAM also cut on the stones, that
    there is not the least occasion to say any thing farther upon that
    point.</p>

  <p>The third line can be no other way filled up, than as I have done it by
    the pricked letters: I must own, however, that I have had some scruple
    about the phrase of DOMVS DIVINA, the same thing as DOMVS AVGVSTA, the
    <em>imperial family</em>; which I cannot say occurs, with any certainty
    of the time it was used in, before the reign of Antoninus Pius, from
    whom, down to Constantine the Great, it is very frequently met with in
    inscriptions. This kept me some time in suspence, whether this found
    at Chichester could be of so early a date as the time of Claudius: but
    as we find several inscriptions in Gruter with those words in them,
    or I. H. D. D. <i lang="la">In Honorem Domus Divinæ</i>, which is much the same
    thing, without any mark of the time when they were cut, they may have
    been before the reign of Antoninus Pius, and then only came into more
    general use; and as the time that Cogidunus lived in, will not let
    this be of a later standing, I think we may offer it as an authority
    for the use of this piece of flattery to the emperors long before that
    excellent prince came to the purple.</p>

  <p>The third line, as I believe, was EX AVCTORITATE. TIB. CLAVD. and
    the fourth COGIDVBNI. R. LEG. &amp;c. that is, <i lang="la">Ex auctoritate Tiberii
    Claudii Cogidubni regis, legati Augusti in Britannia</i>; for the
    following reasons: we are informed by Tacitus, <i lang="la">in vita Agricolæ</i>,
    <i>cap.</i> 14. that after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> Britain had been reduced to a Roman
    province by the successful arms of Aulus Plautius, and Ostorius
    Scapula, under the emperor Claudius, <i lang="la">Quædam civitates</i> Cogiduno
    Regi <i lang="la">erant donatæ, is ad nostram usque memoriam fidissimus remansit,
    vetere ac jam pridem recepta Populi Romani consuetudine ut haberet
    instrumenta servitutis</i> &amp; Reges. This <em>Cogidunus</em> seems to be
    the same person as <em>Cogidubnus</em> in our inscription, the letter
    B in the third syllable making little or no difference in the word,
    especially if pronounced soft, as it ought to be, like a V consonant.</p>

  <p>It is so well known to have been the custom of the Roman <em>Liberti</em>
    and <em>Clientes</em>, to take the names of their patrons and
    benefactors, it would be wasting of time to prove the constant usage of
    that practice. Now, as this <em>Cogidubnus</em>, who in all probability
    was a petty prince of that part of the <em>Dobuni</em> which had
    submitted to Claudius, and one that continued many years faithful to
    him and the Romans, (<i lang="la">vide Tacit. ut supra</i>) had given him the
    government of some part of the island by that emperor, nothing could be
    more grateful in regard to Claudius, nor more honourable to himself,
    after he was <em>romanised</em>, than to take the names of a benefactor
    to whom he was indebted for his kingdom, and so call himself TIBERIVS
    CLAVDIVS COGIDVBNVS.</p>

  <p>I suppose him to have been a <em>Regulus</em> of the <em>Dobuni</em>;
    because we are told by Dion Cassius (<em>in lib.</em> lx.) that Aulus
    Plautius having put to flight Cataratacus and <em>Togodumnus</em>,
    sons of Cunobelin, part of the <em>Boduni</em> (the same people as the
    <em>Dobuni</em>) who were subject to the <em>Catuellani</em>, submitted
    to the Romans; and the name <em>Cogidubnus</em>, or <em>Cogiduvnus</em>,
    <span class="antiqua">Coc o Dubn</span>, or <span class="antiqua">Duvn</span>, (<i lang="la">vid. Baxteri Glossar. in
    verbis</i> Cogidumnus, &amp; Dobuni) signifying expresly in the British
    language PRINCEPS DOBVNORVM, seems to put the matter out of all doubt.</p>

  <p>How far his territories extended, it is impossible to define. Bishop
    Stillingfleet, <cite>Orig. Britan.</cite> p. 63. supposes them to have
    lain in Surrey and Sussex. Sussex certainly was part of them, since
    the temple mentioned in this inscription was erected in it by his
    authority; and it is not unlikely, that besides the <em>Regni</em>,
    who were the people of those two counties, he might have that part
    of the <em>Dobuni</em> which had submitted to the Romans, and seems to
    have been his own principality, together with the <em>Ancalites</em>,
    <em>Bibroci</em> and <em>Segontiaci</em>, whose countries lay between
    the <em>Dobuni</em> and the <em>Regni</em>, bestowed upon him; the words
    <i lang="la">civitates quædam</i>, in Tacitus, not importing no more than some
    <em>few towns</em>, but <em>several people</em>; the word <em>civitas</em>
    always signifying a <em>people</em> in that historian.</p>

  <p>Before I proceed any farther, it will not be amiss to observe, that
    <em>Togodumnus</em> and <em>Cogidubnus</em>, though their names are so
    much alike, were two distinct persons: the first was son of Cunobelin,
    king of the <em>Trinobantes</em>, vanquished and killed in battle by
    Aulus Plautius; the second, a prince that submitted to Ostorius
    Scapula, and continued in his fidelity to the Romans, <i lang="la">in nostram
    usque memoriam</i>, says Tacitus, who was born at the latter end of
    Claudius’s reign; so that <em>Togodumnus</em> was probably dead before
    <em>Cogidubnus</em> had his government conferred upon him.</p>

  <p>I call it his government; for though, by the letter ·R· standing in the
    inscription with a point both before and after it, by which it plainly
    denotes an intire word of itself, it may seem that it was intended for
    COGIDVBNI REGIS, and I believe was so in respect of his <em>quondam</em>
    dignity, yet it is evident, that he had condescended to take the title
    of LEGATVS AVGVSTI IN BRITANNIA from Claudius: and that too must have
    been only over those people that he had given him the government of;
    Aulus Plautius, Ostorius Scapula, Didius Gallus, Avitus Veranius,
    and Suetonius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> Paullinus, having the supreme command successively
    about this time in this island, the second and last of which are
    called expresly <em>Legati</em> by Tacitus, <em>lib.</em> xii. <em>Ann.
    cap.</em> 23. &amp; <em>Vit. Agric. cap.</em> 15. The <em>Legati Cæsaris</em>,
    or <em>Augusti,</em> were those <i lang="la">qui Cæsaribus subditas regebant
    Provincias</i>.</p>

  <p>The sixth line has lost at the beginning the letters COLLE; but so much
    remains of the word, as makes it to have been indubitably, when intire,
    COLLEGIVM; and the following letters are an abbreviation of FABRORVM.</p>

  <p>These colleges of artificers were very ancient at Rome, as ancient as
    their second king Numa Pompilius, if we may believe Plutarch (<cite>in
    vit. Numæ</cite>) who tells us, that the people were divided by him into
    what we at this day call <em>Companies of Tradesmen</em>, and mentions
    the Τέκτονες or <em>Fabri</em> among them; though Floras (<i>lib.</i>
    i. <i>cap.</i> 6.) says, that <em>Populus Romanus a</em> Servio Tullio
    <i lang="la">relatus suit in Censum, digestus in Classes, Curiis atque</i>
    Collegiis <i lang="la">distributus</i>. But as the power of the Romans extended
    itself, it carried the arts of that great people along with it, and
    improved the nations that it subdued, by civilizing, and teaching
    them the use of whatever was necessary or advantageous among their
    conquerors; from which most wise and generous disposition, among other
    beneficial institutions, we find these <em>Collegia</em> to have been
    established in every part of the empire, from the frequent mention
    of them in the inscriptions collected by Gruter, Spon, and other
    antiquaries.</p>

  <p>Several sorts of workmen were included under the name of <em>Fabri</em>,
    particularly all those that were concerned in any kind of building;
    whence we meet with the <em>Fabri Ferrarii</em>, <em>Lignarii</em>,
    <em>Tignarii</em>, <em>Materiarii</em>, <em>Navales</em>, and others: the
    last named may have been the authors of dedicating this temple to
    Neptune, having so near a relation to the sea, from which the city
    of Chichester is at so small a distance, that perhaps that arm of it
    which still comes up within two miles of its walls, might formerly
    have washed them. The rest of the fraternity might very well pay the
    same devotion to Minerva, the Goddess of all arts and sciences, and
    patroness of the Dædalian profession.</p>

  <p>As no less than five letters are wanting at the beginning of the sixth
    line, there cannot be fewer lost at the beginning of the seventh,
    where the stone is more broke away than above; so that probably there
    were six when it was perfect. What we have left of them is only the
    top of an S: I will not therefore take upon me to affirm any thing
    as to the reading of them, which is so intirely defaced: perhaps
    it was A. SACR. S. <i lang="la">a sacris sunt</i>; perhaps it was HONOR. S.
    <i lang="la">Honorati sunt</i>: as to the former, we find these <em>Collegia</em>
    had their <em>Sacerdotes</em>; therefore <i lang="la">Qui a sacris sunt</i>, which
    is found in inscriptions, (<cite>vid. Grut. Corp.</cite> xxix. 8. cxxi.
    <span class="smcap">i. dcxxxii. i.</span>) would be no improper term to express them;
    or it might have been SACER. S. <em>sacerdotes sunt</em>, since we find
    such mentioned in the following inscriptions. <cite>Spon. Miscell. Erud.
    Antiq.</cite> p. 58.</p>

  <p>So that the vacuity in our inscription may very well have been filled
    up with one or other of these words; and the three next letters that
    follow them, D. S. D. <i lang="la">de suo dedicaverunt</i>, will agree with
    either of them, and what precedes them.</p>

  <p>The last line has been PVDENTE PVDENTINI FILio: but there must have
    been a letter or two of the <em>prænomen</em> at the beginning of it,
    unless it was shorter than the rest at that, as well as at the latter
    end of it: and from what I have said, the whole may be read as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i lang="la">Neptuno &amp; Minervæ Templum pro Salute Domus Divinæ, ex Auctoritate
      Tiberii Claudii Cogidubni Regis, Legati Augusti in Brittanniâ,

      Dedicaverunt, Donante aream Pudente Pudentini Filio.</i></p>

    <p>Chichester, by this inscription found at it, must have been a town of
      eminence very soon after the Romans had settled here, and in process
      of time seems to have been much frequented, by the Roman roads, still
      visible, that terminate here from Portsmouth, Midhurst, and Arundel;
      though, what is very strange, we have no Roman name now for it. I once
      thought it might have put in its claim for <em>Anderida</em>, which our
      antiquaries have not yet agreed to fix any where, being situated, very
      near, both to the <em>Sylva Anderida</em>, and the <em>southern Coast</em>
      of the island, the two properties of that city: <i>vid.</i> Camb. Brit.
      and Somner’s Roman Ports and Forts. But Henry of Huntingdon, who lived
      in the time of Henry II. telling us, that the Saxons so destroyed
      <em>Andredecester</em>, that <i lang="la">Nunquam postea reædificata fuit, &amp; locus
      tantum quasi nobilissimæ urbis transeuntibus ostenditur desolatus</i>,
      pag. 312. (<i>Vid.</i> Dr. Tabor’s Discourse of <em>Anderida</em>,
      Philos. Transact. N<sup>o</sup> 356.) it could not be Chichester; for that was
      not only rebuilt before his time, but was a place of such note, that
      when the bishops, soon after the Conquest, anno Dom. 1076. removed
      their churches from small decayed towns, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> several of them were
      then seated, <i lang="la">in urbes celebriores</i>, Stigand, then bishop of
      Selsey, settled his episcopal chair at that place.</p>

    <p>I shall conclude with observing, that when this inscription was dug
      up, there were also two walls of stone discovered close by it, three
      foot thick each, one running north, the other east, and joining in an
      angle, as the North-street and St. Martin’s lane now turn, which, in
      all probability, were part of the foundations of the temple mentioned
      on the marble.</p>

    <div class="right">October 31. 1723.</div>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To this judicious elucidation of the inscription I have nothing to
    add, but that it seems to me probable enough, that Pudens, mentioned
    therein to have given the ground upon which the temple was built, was
    that Aulus Pudens who married the famous British lady Claudia Rufina,
    celebrated for her wit, beauty and eloquence. There is room enough in
    the stone to suppose the letter A at least, as his <em>prænomen</em> was
    in that part which is lost. <i lang="la">Moncæius de incunab. regiis eccles.
    christ. vet. Britann.</i> thinks Claudia, mentioned by St. Paul,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
    2 Tim. iv. 21. was daughter of the renowned Caratacus, converted to
    christianity by him, and married to this Pudens, a Roman Senator. But
    this may be judged rather too early, on account of the time of St.
    Paul’s death, and that wherein Martial lived, who wrote two elegant
    epigrams upon her; and we may with more likelihood conclude her to be
    the daughter of our <em>Cogidunus</em>, who lived to Tacitus his time,
    which was the same as Martial’s: and there is equal reason for the name
    of Claudia to be given her in honour of Claudius the emperor, as for
    the king her father taking the same upon himself, as appears in this
    inscription. Martial’s first epigram upon her is the 13th in his IV.

  <p class="noindent">We may well imagine this was wrote in the reign of Domitian, by the
    first epigram in that book being in honour of that emperor’s birth day;
    and sixteen years at least must have passed between that and the time
    of St. Paul’s death, which happened the last year of Nero. The other
    epigram is the 54th of XI. <i>L.</i></p>

  <p class="noindent">We may conclude, that if she had been of age sufficient to be converted
    by St. Paul, she would about this time have been too old to have
    children, and be accounted beautiful. But times and all circumstances
    conspire sufficiently to make her the daughter of <em>Cogidunus</em>.</p>

  <p>Famous was the contest between Neptune and Minerva in naming the city
    of Athens, which they referred to the umpire of Apollo: he, to avoid
    the <em>odium</em> of appearing partial on either side, left it to the
    decision of mortal men, as Varro tells us: howsoever, these two deities
    are happily reconciled in a joint partnership of the dedication of this
    temple. The antiquaries are still <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>at variance about the ancient name
    of this city. Therefore, Sir, that I may not be wholly an unworthy
    fellow-traveller, <i lang="la">passibus etsi longe inequalibus</i>, I shall
    venture, if Minerva is not averse, to offer my thoughts towards a
    recovery of the Roman denomination of Chichester, which appears plainly
    to have been an eminent and early station: though the journey of
    Antoninus reaches it not, yet it would be strange if Ravennas should
    have passed it by, who is very particular in this part of the island.</p>

  <p>I observe the river this city stands upon is called <em>Lavant</em>.
    There are three towns synonymous higher up, East, West, and Middle
    Lavant; whence I think we may conclude, that the true and original
    name of the river was <em>Antona</em>, not an uncommon appellative of
    such in the Celtic dialect: Mr. Baxter, voce <em>Anderida</em>, calls
    it <em>Ant</em>. Likewise a town called <em>Hampnet</em> stands upon
    it, which seems some corruption of <em>Antona</em>. Now there are two
    rivers of this name falling into the southern ocean; that which we
    spoke of lately, the Itchin, running by <em>Trausantum</em>; and this
    we are upon: therefore it appears natural and necessary that they
    should some way or other be distinguished from one another: the former
    <em>Trausantum</em>, Mr. Baxter, voce <em>Antona</em>, says signifies
    the farther <em>Antona</em>; and in this same sense, but in a later
    manner, Ninius calls it <em>Trahannon</em>; as our monk Ravennas,
    <em>Onna</em>, by a softer pronunciation. Our river then must be the
    hither or nearer <em>Antona</em>, however actually distinguished;
    which we must find out. Looking into that author generally called
    <em>Anonymus</em>, though I suppose his true name is <em>Ravennas</em>, as
    born there, (it being at that time the method of the ecclesiastics to
    take the sirname of their native towns) he thus mentions some cities
    hereabouts: <em>Caleba Atrebatum</em>, <em>Anderesio</em>, <em>Miba</em>,
    <span class="sidenote smcap">Mantantonis.</span><em>Mutuantonis</em>, <em>Lemanis</em>, <em>Dubris</em>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Now I
    imagine <em>Mutuantonis</em> is the place here sought for. <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXI.</span>This author
    probably transcribed these names from inspection of a map, sometimes
    casting his eye along a road, sometimes a river, sea-coast or the like,
    and sometimes <em>per saltum</em>: when he has been reciting many names
    of cities in the inland parts as far as <em>Corinium Dobunorum</em>,
    or Cirencester, he returns to the south-east part of the island, and
    begins a new period, as above. Directly in his way to the sea-coasts
    is <em>Caleba</em>, or Farnham, as I shall show in proper place: next
    is <em>Anderida</em>; which cannot be this place, for the reason you
    brought out of Henry of Huntingdon: no doubt it is somewhere upon the
    Sussex coast; but its particular site I shall not take upon me now to
    determine. <em>Miba</em> is with good reason thought to be Midhurst;
    then very naturally follows <em>Mutuantonis</em>, our Chichester: hence
    he takes his route eastward towards <em>Lemanis</em>, <em>Dubris</em>,
    <i>&amp;c.</i> in Kent. In short, the evidence is this: the author is
    plainly describing these parts; and where should <em>Mutuantonis</em>
    stand, but upon the river <em>Antona</em>? and it does not appear, that
    any other river hereabouts is so called; or, if it did, <em>Anderida</em>
    may very well thither be referred, which cannot possibly to this place.
    I take the name of <em>lavant</em>, or <em>mutuant</em>, to be synonymous
    words in the British language, to distinguish it, as we said, from
    <em>trausant</em>;, for <em>llafar</em> signifies <em>sonorous</em>,
    <em>loquax</em>; and <em>mwth</em> is <em>citus</em>, <em>velox</em>; either of
    which, prefixed to <em>Antona</em>, describe this rapid or noisy river;
    and in effect we find it remarkably so. Dr. Holland in his notes at
    the bottom of Mr. Camden expresly observes, that this river, though
    sometimes quite dry, at others, and that very often in the midst of
    summer, is so full as to run very violently: this, no doubt, is owing
    to its rise in the neighbouring high grounds to the north; for from
    them it must needs fall with an impetuous torrent. Further, it may
    possibly be derived from the British <em>llai minor</em>, signifying the
    <em>lesser Antona</em>, from its short course; the consonant <i>v</i>,
    or <i>f</i> which is its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> equivalent, being interposed <i lang="la">euphoniæ
    gratia</i>: or if Mr. Baxter’s correction of <em>Mantantonis</em> be
    thought just, then it signifies the mouth of the river <em>Antona</em>;
    and Chichester now stands very near its inlet into the sea, and
    formerly nearer. What way soever we take it, it seems reasonable to
    conclude this is the place. Though it was not properly a sea-port town,
    yet it is plainly near enough for the establishment of the <i lang="la">collegium
    fabrorum</i> here; and the vast plenty of wood from the adjoining
    forest favoured their work, whether of timber or the forge. Since
    this inscription, there was found a Mosaic pavement in Mrs. Downes’s
    garden; and when that was pulled in pieces as usual, a brass coin was
    discovered under it of Nero and Drusus Cæs. on one side, represented
    on horseback; on the other, <cite>C. Cæsar Divi aug. pron. aug. p. m. tr.
    p.</cite> <span class="allsmcap">IIII.</span> <i>pp.</i> which no doubt was there deposited to
    show the <em>æra</em> of that work.</p>

  <p>A little way out of the city northward, we passed by a Roman camp,
    called Brill, I suppose Bury hill, in Ogilby’s maps called <em>Beauty’s
    bank</em>: the Roman road called Stone-street causeway, goes directly
    north-east from hence through this country, and by Darking church-yard
    in Surrey; <span class="sidenote">TAB. LXXXII.</span>then falls into the Hermen-street at Woodcote.</p>

  <p>St. Roc’s hill is a fine elevation, with a spacious circular camp
    on the top, of a round form, a <i lang="la">castrum æstivum</i>, belonging to
    <em>Mantantonis</em>. Here is a foundation of a chapel, or a beacon,
    perhaps both: the reader may gather an idea of the view here from
    <span class="sidenote">TAB. XLIII.</span><a href="#i_150">plate 43</a>. At Midhurst is a fine old seat called Cowdrey, belonging
    to the Browns viscount Montacute: it stands in a valley incompassed
    with lawns, hills and woods, thrown into a park, the river running
    underneath. It is a large house of stone, consisting of one court:
    the hall is cieled of Irish oak after the ancient manner; <span class="sidenote smcap">Mida.</span>the walls
    painted with architecture by Roberti, the statues by Goupé, the
    stair-case by Pelegrini: the room at the end of the hall is of
    Holbein’s painting, where that famous old artist has described the
    exploits of Henry VIII. before Bulloign, Calais, his landing at
    Portsmouth, his magnificent entry into London, &amp;c. In the other rooms
    are many excellent pictures of the ancestors of the family, and other
    history-painting of Holbein’s, relating to their actions in war. The
    whole circuit of rooms above stairs are stately and well furnished,
    adorned with many pictures: there is a long gallery with the twelve
    apostles as big as the life; another very neat one, wainscotted with
    Norway oak, where are many ancient whole-length pictures of the family
    in their proper habits, which is a very elegant notion: there are four
    history pieces; two copies of Raphael’s marriage of Cupid and Psyche;
    several old religious and military paintings from Battle-abbey. The
    road to Midhurst to us appeared Roman, and therefore strengthens the
    supposition of its being <em>Mida</em>.</p>

  <p>St. Roc’s hill is upon the chalky down running east and west: north
    of it to Farnham it is sandy, full of <em>erica</em>; but the valleys
    are rich, warm and woody. The heaths between Farnham and Godalmin are
    full of barrows. Ferndon hill in the way to Godalmin is very steep
    northwards, and of an hour’s descent; which you rise to insensibly: it
    runs east and west.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Calleva Atrebatum.</span></div>

  <div class="sidenote">TAB. XLIV. 2d Vol.</div>

  <p>At Farnham is the bishop of Winchester’s palace, a magnificent ancient
    structure of the castle-form, deeply moted, and strongly walled about,
    with towers at proper distance: it stands upon the edge of a hill,
    where is a fine park. One large and broad street of the town, below
    hill, fronts the castle; the main of the rest of the town consists of
    a long strait street crossing it at right angles, which is the Roman
    road coming from Winchester: the river runs parallel to it on the
    south: this is a fine rich soil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> with much sand in it, and has an
    extraordinary propriety for the growth of hops. This place I take to
    be the <em>Caleva Atrebatum</em>;<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> which because it is a notion of
    my own advancing, it requires that I should a little enlarge upon it,
    and propose it to your discerning judgement. This has been hitherto
    matter of dispute among antiquaries, and I think cannot otherwise
    be settled than in fixing it at this place: it will make this VIIth
    journey of Antoninus and some more very clear, that otherwise labour
    under insuperable difficulties: therefore this I propose to be the true
    scheme of that journey.</p>

  <p class="noindent">We have no difference in the copies, but in the sum total at top, which
    is owing only to a transposition of the letters C and X. therefore all
    we have to do is to find out the towns; the particular numbers being
    indisputably right, and rightly cast up in the <cite>Suritan</cite> edition;
    and all the places that admit any question, are only <em>Calleva</em>
    and <em>Pontes</em>, which in this manner mutually prove one another,
    as being absolutely conformable to geography, and the nearest way one
    should chuse to go at this day, and having from Southampton a Roman
    road accompanying all the way. This summer I rode through Winchester
    and Farnham, through Alresford and Alton, and observed in many places
    signs sufficient of that nature; though it is horridly out of repair,
    and even in the midst of summer very bad, notwithstanding such plenty
    of materials every where to mend it: this has obliged coaches and
    horsemen frequently to make excursions for their ease and safety. Mr.
    Aubury likewise pronounces it a Roman road long since in his manuscript
    collections. Between Farnham and Alton the bank is visible, in several
    places between Alresford and Alton: the right reverend author of the
    additions to Camden takes notice of it. The distance is twenty two
    miles, as in the Itinerary; but to Wallingford, where Mr. Camden places
    it, it is thirty; to Henley somewhat more: beside, from the one you
    must cross the Thames three times, from the other twice in the way
    to London; a thing the Romans would certainly avoid, if possible:
    but from Farnham by way of Stanes is the direct road, and distances
    correspondent as before.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Perhaps the last X in the sum total was corrupted into a V after the
    station was dropped out. The first part of it here establishes the site
    of <em>Calleva</em> in respect to <em>Venta Belgarum</em>; as in the XIIIth
    and XIVth journeys in respect to <em>Spina</em>; so that it is proved
    from different points of a triangle, and as it were by mathematical
    demonstration.</p>

  <p>I imagine the occasion of over-sight in this matter is owing to Mr.
    Camden’s settling the <em>Atrebates</em> in Berkshire; and his authority,
    no doubt, with every one is of the greatest weight deservedly: yet I
    suppose his only reason for it is because he thought Wallingford the
    <em>Calleva Atrebatum</em>, as having some resemblance to his supposed
    <em>Gallena</em>. In his Roman map he has set these <em>Atrebates</em>
    partly north of the Thames in Oxfordshire, where himself puts the
    <em>Ancalites</em>, and partly south, where rightly he fixes the
    <em>Bibroci</em> in Berkshire: this is in my judgement too far northward.
    I doubt not but the <em>Bibroci</em> inhabited Berkshire intirely to the
    Thames, as I proved in a former letter; to which we may add, that if,
    as he says, this country was called by the Saxons <em>Berrocscyre</em>,
    there can be no difficulty in asserting the word derived from
    <em>Bibroci</em>. The <em>Atrebates</em> came undoubtedly from <em>Gallia
    Belgica</em>, where were a people of the same name upon the sea-coasts;
    and if we place them here in Surrey about this their capital, they
    may with some propriety with Mr. Camden be said here in Britain to
    live over-against their own country, where Ptolemy places them in
    the maritime parts upon the Sein; but not if he sends them up to the
    top of the Thames: nor is it probable they should have penetrated so
    far up the country, even beyond their brethren the <em>Belgæ</em>, by
    all allowed the most powerful colony of transmarine people at that
    time. The <em>Segontiaci</em> as well as <em>Bibroci</em>, on this side
    the Thames, would confessedly oppose such passage; therefore, if we
    give Sussex to the <em>Regni</em>, we must reserve Surrey for these
    <em>Atrebates</em>, and Farnham their capital; and this is agreeable to
    Ptolemy, who places them next the <em>Cantii</em>.</p>

  <p>A little without Farnham eastward, the road divides into two branches
    with an acute angle: one goes to Guildford and Darking, where it
    meets the Stane-street coming from Chichester; the other to Stanes,
    which I prosecuted to Farnborow, probably a station or inn, or camp
    to secure the road over this wild country; for it is deep sand from
    Farnham to Egham: but where in particular the Roman road went is not
    easy to define, because of the extraordinary sandiness of the whole
    country:<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> but at Frimley,
    near <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>here, about sixteen year ago, an
    urn with Roman coins and intaglia’s was found: Mr. Titchburn had them.
    This is directly in the way to Farnbarow. I suppose there was a Roman
    way from Silchester through Stretley, Hartley row, Harford bridge,
    which signifies <i lang="la">trajectus militaris</i>, but from the mooryness of
    the soil is quite worn away. I take this road to be a continuation of
    that coming from the Bath by Marlborough;<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> but at Stanes I saw
    our road very evidently go through the fields west of the bridge, and
    directly over-against it;<span class="sidenote">TAB. LVI.</span> for it must be understood that the Romans
    drew a road, as I said before, under the Icening-street, and parallel
    to it, which went from <em>Regnum</em> to London. This is what we have
    been upon, and composes this VIIth <em>Iter</em>: From thence it passed
    through Colchester to the sea-coasts of Suffolk. Now between Stanes
    and London it is notorious, being the common road at present, till you
    come to Turnham green:<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> there the present road through Hammersmith
    and Kensington leaves it; for it passes more northward upon the common,
    where to a discerning eye the trace of it is manifest; then it goes
    over a little brook called from it Stanford-bridge, and comes into the
    Acton road at a common, and a bridge, a little west of Camden house, so
    along Hyde-park wall, and crosses the Watling-street at Tyburn, then
    along Oxford-road. But of this part of it, going to Old-street, north
    of London, I spoke before.</p>

  <p>Between Oxford-street and Stanes, this Roman road was originally drawn
    through Brentford, which undoubtedly was a mansion between them; and
    this is a very strait line: I rode the broken part of it between Acton
    road and Turnham green: it is still a narrow strait way, keeping its
    original direction, but full of dangerous sloughs, being a clayey soil
    and never repaired: it butts full upon Stanes bridge, and then beyond
    it passes forward in a strait line through gardens and yards into the
    corn-fields, where its ridge is still left, the highest part of all the
    field, though they plough close to it on both sides; and it is now a
    road for three quarters of a mile; then it enters a narrow lane, and
    at last degenerates into a foot-path toward Thorp-lea, in the way to
    Farnham; the common road leaving it all this while in the way to Egham.
    So that undoubtedly Stanes was the <span class="sidenote smcap">Pontes.</span><em>Pontes</em> of Antoninus;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>

    coasts of Northumberland in a piratical manner, was repelled by the
    forces of Morcar, and his brother Edwin. Tostin goes into Scotland,

    surprise the two brothers overjoyed at their late victory, and shut

    <p>Tostin, son of earl Godwin, was earl of Northumberland, and turned out,

      Edwin, lived there very lovingly together, and when Harold the king was
      slain by William the Conqueror, offered themselves to the people, who
      might chuse one of them for their king. Harold and they were cousins;
      and they were at London at the time of the battle of Hastings: but
      William the Conqueror’s fortune prevailed both in getting the battle,
      and in getting the kingdom. Afterwards they disturbed the Conqueror by
      little inroads and vexations, and were sometimes taken prisoners; yet
      he pardoned them, and married them to his relations. At length they
      were slain perfidiously by their own men, and the king was much grieved

    hereabouts extremely fine and delightful: an excellent kind of stone is
    dug up in Grimsthorp park; and here and there a vein of good marble of

    Leicester must be left out, and they travelled with the queen’s corpse
    by way of Oundle to Geddington from Stanford, I suppose the present
    London road from Stanford being unpassable, or not having at that time

    <p>It is very easy to discern where the old Roman road becomes the present
      road northward, by the alteration of its direction, near a little rill
      between Wadesmill and Ware. Wadesmill was a Roman ford, <i>vadum</i>,
      <i>wath</i>; whence its name: and from hence the Roman road is the

    <a id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60" class="label">[60]</a> May 15, 1732, I rode between Huntingdon and Cambridge,
    and discovered evidently that it was a Roman road all the way, pointing
    strait from Godmanchester to Cambridge castle. When I told this to
    Mr. Roger Gale, then at Cotenham, he said, he had observed that Roman
    road which lies on Gogmagog hills to point likewise upon Cambridge
    castle; so that the ford at Cambridge river is originally Roman: and
    undoubtedly there was a Roman town at Cambridge, for the conveniency
    of passengers and armies between the <i>Iceni</i> and the northern
    parts beyond Huntingdon. I apprehend Chesterton and Grantchester were
    Roman forts and repositories of corn from this country, to be sent to
    Peterborough, and so by the Cardike into the north: and from the bridge
    at Cambridge, Bridge street and St. Andrew’s street are continuations,
    in a very strait line and direction, of the Roman road.

    <p>July, 1742, Mr. collector Collins showed me several Roman coins,

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="label">[117]</a> Among the sand-hills by Sandwich I found a curious
    plant, which I take to be the <i>satyrium abortivum</i>, or bird’s-nest
    of Gerard: it has a bulbous root of a red colour; the stem sometimes
    a foot long, whitish like young asparagus, and almost naked; a
    great spike of white flowers, of the cucullate sort, with a black
    <i>apex</i>: they are exceeding odoriferous. I found much <i>eryngo</i>
    there, which smells pleasantly when broke; and on all the banks of the
    ditches hereabouts garden-fennel grows in great plenty.

    <p>Sandwich is in a miserable, decayed condition, following apace the
      downfall of its mother <i>Rutupium</i>: it might easily be made the
      best harbour on this coast, by cutting a new channel for the river
      about a mile and half through the sand-hills south easterly; for the
      water of the river Stour would sufficiently scour it, did it run
      strait, and with that direction. All the walls and bulworks of the town
      are dismantled, the gates tumbling down; and a few cannon lie scattered
      here and there. This town likewise might be made very strong; for,
      besides the river Stour, another rivulet runs through it, that would
      keep the ditches always full.</p>

    <a id="Footnote_120" href="#FNanchor_120" class="label">[120]</a> To Dover from Canterbury the Watling-street is still
    the common way: it is left intire over Barham downs, with a high ridge
    strait pointing to Canterbury cathedral tower: as soon as it enters
    the downs it traverses a group of Celtic barrows, then leaves a small
    camp of Cæsar’s: further on it has been basely inclosed through two
    fields, and levelled with ploughing: then it passes by a great single
    barrow, whereon stood the mill, which is now removed higher up: then
    it ascends the hill to a hedge corner, where are three barrows, a
    great one between two little ones, all inclosed with a double square
    intrenchment of no great bulk: I fancy them Roman, because parallel to,
    and close by, the Roman road: the great barrow has a cavity at top, and
    an entrance eastward; whether casually, or with design, I know not.
    At Lyddon the Watling-street falls into that noble valley of Dover,
    made of two huge ridges of chalk, which divide themselves into lesser
    valleys, dropping into the great one at regular distances, as the
    little leaves of plants meet at the main stem: this valley, when viewed
    from the end, looks like a landscape on scenes lessening, according
    to perspective, to Dover, between the two <i>Phari</i> and the sea at
    the end, inclosed between them. The street slides along the northern
    declivity, crosses the rivulet which wanders through the midst of the
    valley at Buckland, so to Biggin gate, where is its termination, by the
    side of the old port, having now run from Chester about 250 miles. Many
    barrows on the sides of those hills.

    and perhaps two made of one: for that Simon preached in Britain,
    wrought miracles here, was martyred and buried in Britain, we have the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
